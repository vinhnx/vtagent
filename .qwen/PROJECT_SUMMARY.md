# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Manage and clean up local development files for the VTAgent project while maintaining proper git tracking configuration.

## Key Knowledge
- Project uses Rust-based terminal coding agent with modular architecture
- Key directories that should remain local but not be tracked by git:
  - `.codex`, `.cursor`, `.gemini`, `.qwen`, `.ruler`, `.serena`, `.kiro`
- These directories contain local configuration, cache, and agent-specific data
- Git tracking is managed through `.gitignore` and `.vtagentgitignore` files
- Project follows standard Rust conventions with `vtagent-core/` (library) and `src/` (binary)

## Recent Actions
- Removed all `.bak` files from the project directory
- Successfully removed `.codex`, `.cursor`, `.gemini`, `.qwen`, and `.ruler` directories from git tracking while preserving them locally
- Extended this to include `.serena` and `.kiro` directories as well
- Updated `.gitignore` to include `.serena` directory to prevent future tracking
- All changes have been committed to the local repository

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Remove .bak files from project
2. [DONE] Remove .codex, .cursor, .gemini, .qwen, .ruler from git tracking while keeping locally
3. [DONE] Remove .serena and .kiro from git tracking while keeping locally
4. [DONE] Update .gitignore to prevent future tracking of these directories
5. [TODO] Review and update .vtagentgitignore content for vtagent (as currently selected by user)
