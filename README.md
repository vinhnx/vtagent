## Highlights

- **Multi-provider agent** with first-class integrations for OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, and OpenRouter, including auto-failover and cost guards.
- **Semantic code intelligence** using tree-sitter parsers for Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and Java, combined with ast-grep powered structural search and refactors.
- **Modern terminal experience** built with Ratatui: mouse support, streaming PTY output, slash commands, customizable Ciapre-inspired theming, and ANSI-accurate rendering.
- **Workspace aware by default**: Git-aware fuzzy navigation, boundary enforcement, command allowlists, and human-in-the-loop confirmations.
- **Config driven**: every agent behavior is controlled via [vtcode.toml](https://github.com/vinhnx/vtcode/blob/main/vtcode.toml), backed by constants in `vtcode-core/src/config/constants.rs` and up-to-date model IDs in `docs/models.json`.

## Quickstart

### Installing and running VT Code

VT Code can be installed using multiple package managers depending on your preference:

**Using Cargo (Rust package manager) - Recommended for Rust developers:**

```shell
cargo install vtcode
```

**Using Homebrew (macOS only):**

```shell
brew install vinhnx/tap/vtcode
```

**Using npm (Node.js package manager) - Cross-platform:**

```shell
npm install -g vtcode
```

After installation with any method, simply run `vtcode` to get started:

```shell
vtcode
```

<details>
<summary>You can also download pre-built binaries from <a href="https://github.com/vinhnx/vtcode/releases/latest">GitHub Releases</a>.</summary>

Available for:

- **macOS**: Apple Silicon (`aarch64-apple-darwin`) and Intel (`x86_64-apple-darwin`)
- **Linux**: x86_64 and ARM64 architectures
- **Windows**: x86_64 architecture

Each archive contains the executable - extract and rename to `vtcode` if needed.

</details>

### Configuration

Set your API key for your preferred provider:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_key_here"
# or
export XAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
# or
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
# or
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

Alternatively, create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```shell
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
XAI_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
```

VT Code supports advanced configuration via `vtcode.toml`. See [Configuration](docs/project/) for details.

### Getting Started

Launch the agent with explicit provider/model flags or rely on the defaults from `vtcode.toml`:

```shell
vtcode --provider openai --model gpt-5-codex
```

Persist your preferred defaults in configuration rather than hardcoding them:

```toml
[agent]
provider = "openai"
default_model = "gpt-5-codex"
```

Model identifiers should always reference `vtcode-core/src/config/constants.rs` and `docs/models.json` to stay aligned with vetted releases.

---

## Usage

- Launch interactive mode with your preferred provider/model:

    ```shell
    vtcode --provider openai --model gpt-5-codex
    ```

- Run a single prompt with streaming output (scripting friendly):

    ```shell
    vtcode ask "Summarize diagnostics in src/lib.rs"
    ```

- Execute a command with tool access disabled (dry run):

    ```shell
    vtcode --no-tools ask "Review recent changes in src/main.rs"
    ```

- When developing locally, the debug script mirrors production defaults:

    ```shell
    ./run-debug.sh
    ```

CLI options are discoverable via `vtcode --help` or `/help` inside the REPL. All defaults live in
`vtcode.toml`, including provider fallbacks, tool allowlists, streaming options, and safety
policies. A Markdown snapshot of the full command tree lives in
[`docs/CommandLineHelp.md`](docs/CommandLineHelp.md); regenerate it with
`cargo run -- --markdown-help > docs/CommandLineHelp.md`.

## Architecture Overview

VT Code is composed of a reusable core library plus a thin CLI binary:

- `vtcode-core/` contains the agent runtime: provider abstractions (`llm/`), tool registry (`tools/`), configuration loaders, and tree-sitter integrations.
- `src/main.rs` wires the CLI, TUI, and runtime together using `clap` for argument parsing and Ratatui for rendering.
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools extend the agent with contextual resources; configuration lives in `vtcode.toml` and enables systems like Serena MCP for journaling and memory.
- Tree-sitter parsers and ast-grep power semantic analysis; both are orchestrated asynchronously with Tokio for responsive command handling.

Design goals prioritize composability, guarded execution, and predictable performance. The architecture document in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` dives deeper into module responsibilities and extension hooks.

## Configuration Reference

- All agent knobs live in `vtcode.toml`; never hardcode credentials or model IDs.
- Constants (model aliases, file size limits, defaults) are centralized in `vtcode-core/src/config/constants.rs`.
- The latest provider-specific model identifiers are tracked in `docs/models.json`; update it alongside configuration changes.
- Safety settings include workspace boundary enforcement, command allow/deny lists, rate limits, and telemetry toggles.

Refer to the guides under `docs/project/` for deep dives on providers, tools, and runtime profiles.

---

## Development Workflow

- `cargo check` for fast validation; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` to enforce linting.
- Format with `cargo fmt` and run `cargo test` for unit and integration coverage.
- `./run-debug.sh` launches the debug build with live reload-friendly options.
- Benchmarks live in `benches/`, and additional examples belong in `tests/` (avoid ad-hoc scripts).
- Ensure configuration updates are reflected in `docs/project/` and `docs/models.json` when relevant.
