# AST-grep Tools Implementation Status - Updated

## Current Implementation Status

After running tests and examining the code, here's the accurate status of AST-grep tools:

### 1. Partially Implemented Tools

#### `ast_grep_search` PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Implementation**: Currently delegates to `rp_search` (ripgrep-based search)
- **Status**: Works but does not provide true AST-grep functionality
- **Behavior**: Performs text-based search rather than syntax-aware AST pattern matching

#### `ast_grep_transform` NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Implementation**: Returns error "ast_grep_transform not implemented yet"
- **Status**: Placeholder only

#### `ast_grep_lint` NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Implementation**: Returns error "ast_grep_lint not implemented yet"
- **Status**: Placeholder only

#### `ast_grep_refactor` NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Implementation**: Returns error "ast_grep_refactor not implemented yet"
- **Status**: Placeholder only

### 2. Test Results Confirmation

Our test confirmed:
1. `ast_grep_search` works but performs regular text search (not AST-aware)
2. Other tools return "not implemented yet" errors as expected

### 3. Code Analysis

Looking at the source code in `vtcode-core/src/tools.rs`:
```rust
/// Search using AST-grep patterns
async fn ast_grep_search(&self, args: Value) -> Result<Value> {
    self.rp_search(args).await  // Delegates to regular ripgrep search
}

/// Transform code using AST-grep patterns
async fn ast_grep_transform(&self, args: Value) -> Result<Value> {
    let _args = args;
    Ok(json!({ "success": false, "error": "ast_grep_transform not implemented yet" }))
}
// Similar for lint and refactor tools
```

### 4. Discrepancy Between Documentation and Implementation

#### Documentation Claims
**COMPLETED**: ast-grep Integration - The Unstoppable Coding Monster

#### Reality
**PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**: Only one tool delegates to basic search, others are placeholders

This represents a significant gap between claimed and actual functionality.

## Impact Assessment

### Technical Impact
- Users expecting AST-aware pattern matching will receive text-based results instead
- Advanced refactoring, linting, and transformation capabilities are missing
- No syntax-aware code understanding as advertised

### User Experience Impact
- Misleading documentation creates false expectations
- Partial implementation may confuse users about tool capabilities
- Missing functionality reduces the "intelligence" of the coding agent

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update Documentation**: Clearly indicate which AST-grep tools are implemented vs. planned
2. **Improve Error Messages**: Make it clearer that some tools are placeholders
3. **Add Feature Detection**: Inform users when they're using delegated functionality

### Long-term Implementation
1. **Option 1**: Integrate with external `ast-grep` CLI tool
2. **Option 2**: Implement native AST-grep engine using existing tree-sitter dependencies
3. **Option 3**: Hybrid approach combining both

### Implementation Priority
1. `ast_grep_transform` - Most valuable for safe code modifications
2. `ast_grep_lint` - Important for code quality
3. `ast_grep_refactor` - Valuable for intelligent suggestions
4. `ast_grep_search` - Enhance with true AST pattern matching

## Conclusion

The AST-grep tools are currently only partially implemented, with significant functionality missing despite documentation claims of completion. While the architecture supports future implementation, users currently have access to only a subset of the promised capabilities.

To fulfill the "unstoppable coding monster" vision, these tools need substantial additional implementation work, or the documentation needs to be updated to accurately reflect current capabilities.
