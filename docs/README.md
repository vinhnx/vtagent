## What Makes VT Code Special

VT Code represents a modern approach to AI-powered software development, featuring:

-   **Single-Agent Reliability (default)** ‚Äì Streamlined, linear agent with robust context engineering
-   **Decision Ledger** ‚Äì Structured, compact record of key decisions injected each turn for consistency
-   **Multi-Provider LLM Support** ‚Äì Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter integration
-   **Advanced Code Intelligence** ‚Äì Tree-sitter parsers for 6+ programming languages
-   **Enterprise-Grade Safety** ‚Äì Comprehensive security controls and path validation
-   **Flexible Configuration** ‚Äì TOML-based configuration with granular policies
-   **Workspace-First Execution** ‚Äì Full read/write/command capabilities anchored to `WORKSPACE_DIR` with built-in indexing workflows

-   **Intelligent Search** - Ripgrep and AST-grep powered code analysis
-   **Fuzzy File Discovery** - Git-aware traversal using `ignore` with `nucleo-matcher` scoring
-   **Symbol Analysis** - Function, class, and variable extraction
-   **Dependency Mapping** - Import relationship analysis
-   **Code Quality Assessment** - Complexity and maintainability scoring

### Comprehensive Tool Suite

-   **Terminal Integration** - Enhanced PTY support for interactive commands
-   **Search & Analysis** - Fast text and syntax-aware code search
-   **Batch Processing** - Efficient multi-file operations
-   **Configuration Management** - Dynamic TOML-based settings

### Safety & Security

-   **Path Validation** - Prevents access outside workspace boundaries
-   **Command Policies** - Allow/deny lists with pattern matching
-   **Human-in-the-Loop** - Confirmation for dangerous operations
-   **File Size Limits** - Configurable resource constraints

## Usage Patterns

### Usage Notes

**LLM Routing:**
To enable LLM routing: set `[router] llm_router_model = "<model-id>"`.

**Budget Tuning:**
To tune budgets: add `[router.budgets.<class>]` with max_tokens and max_parallel_tools.

**Trajectory Logs:**
Logs for trajectory: check `logs/trajectory.jsonl`.

### Workspace-First Operations

-   `WORKSPACE_DIR` always points to the active project root; treat it as the default scope for every command and edit.
-   Use targeted indexing (directory walks, dependency introspection, metadata extraction) before large changes to stay aligned with the current codebase.
-   Keep shell commands and scripts within the workspace unless the workflow explicitly requires external paths.
-   Ask for confirmation before operating outside `WORKSPACE_DIR` or when interacting with untrusted downloads.
-   Launch sessions against another repository with `vtcode /abs/path`; you can also pass `--workspace-dir` (alias: `--workspace`) to other commands when needed.

### Single-Agent Workflows

```bash
# Complex task execution with Decision Ledger
./run.sh chat "Implement user authentication system"

# Codebase analysis
./run.sh analyze
```

### Configuration Management

```bash
# Initialize project configuration
./run.sh init

# Generate complete configuration (preserves existing settings)
./run.sh config

# Generate configuration to custom file
./run.sh config --output my-config.toml

# Edit configuration interactively
./run.sh config --edit

# Validate configuration
./run.sh config --validate
```

**Smart Configuration Generation**: The `config` command implements two-way synchronization that reads your existing `vtcode.toml` and generates a complete template while preserving all your customizations.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

VT Code includes comprehensive testing infrastructure:

### Test Categories

-   **Unit Tests** - Component-level testing with `cargo nextest run`
-   **Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow validation
-   **Performance Tests** - Benchmarking with `cargo bench`
-   **Configuration Tests** - TOML validation and policy testing

### Quality Assurance

```bash
# Run full test suite
cargo nextest run --workspace

# Run with coverage
cargo tarpaulin

# Performance benchmarking
cargo bench

# Linting and formatting
cargo clippy && cargo fmt
```
