# VTAgent Configuration Simplification Changelog

## Overview
This update simplifies the `vtagent.toml` and `vtagent.toml.example` configuration files to make them more approachable for new users while maintaining all core functionality. The changes focus on reducing complexity, improving organization, and providing clearer documentation.

## Changes Made

### vtagent.toml
1. **Streamlined Agent Configuration**
   - Removed implementation-specific parameters (`max_conversation_history`, `max_steps`, `max_empty_responses`)
   - Kept essential parameters for basic agent operation

2. **Simplified Multi-Agent Configuration**
   - Moved complex multi-agent settings to a commented section
   - Kept only the basic enable/disable toggle
   - Added clear documentation that this is a research-preview feature

3. **Improved Organization**
   - Grouped related settings into logical sections with clear comments
   - Removed redundant or rarely used tool policies
   - Simplified command lists while maintaining core functionality

4. **Enhanced Clarity**
   - Added descriptive comments for each section
   - Used consistent formatting and indentation
   - Removed overly specific default values that users rarely need to change

### vtagent.toml.example
1. **Minimal Configuration**
   - Created a truly minimal example focused on essential settings
   - Reduced command lists to the most common use cases
   - Simplified tool policies with clear examples

2. **Clear Documentation**
   - Added explanatory comments for each section
   - Included instructions for customization
   - Provided a simple starting point for new users

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintained all core functionality
   - Preserved existing parameter names and values where appropriate
   - Added notes about advanced features for users who need them

## Benefits
- **Easier Onboarding**: New users can understand and modify the configuration without being overwhelmed
- **Better Organization**: Related settings are grouped logically with clear documentation
- **Maintained Functionality**: All core features remain available with the same capabilities
- **Extensibility**: Advanced users can easily uncomment and customize advanced features
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Simpler configuration is easier to update and maintain

## Backward Compatibility
These changes maintain full backward compatibility. Existing configurations will continue to work without modification. Advanced features like multi-agent coordination are still available but are now organized in a more approachable way.
