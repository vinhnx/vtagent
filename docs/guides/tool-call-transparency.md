# Tool Call Transparency

Agents use the LLM to briefly describe each tool call before execution and summarize the outcome after.

## Requirements

- Pre-call: one-sentence note on purpose
- Post-call: one-sentence summary of result generated by the LLM
- On errors: LLM explains the issue and next step in one sentence
- Keep messages concise and free of jargon
