Interactive chat (tools)
Model: gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17
Workspace: /Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/vtagent
Detected languages: JavaScript:1, Python:1, Rust:160

Welcome! I preloaded workspace context so we can hit the ground running.

Project context:

-   Project: vtagent v0.4.2
-   Root: /Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/vtagent

Languages detected:

-   JavaScript:1, Python:1, Rust:160

Guideline highlights:

-   **Workspace Structure**: `vtagent-core/` (library) + `src/` (binary) with modular tools system
-   **Core Modules**: `llm/` (provider abstraction), `tools/` (modular tool system), `config/` (TOML-based settings)
-   **Integration Points**: Gemini API, tree-sitter parsers, PTY command execution, MCP tools
-   **Primary Config**: `vtagent.toml` (never hardcode settings)

How to work together:

-   Share the outcome you need or ask for a quick /status summary.
-   Reference AGENTS.md expectations before changing files.
-   Prefer focused tool calls (read_file, grep_search) before editing.

Recommended next actions:

-   Request a workspace orientation or describe the task you want to tackle.
-   Confirm priorities or blockers so I can suggest next steps.

Type 'exit' to quit, 'help' for commands
Suggested input: Describe your next coding goal (e.g., "analyze router config")

--> revise welcome message to make it more concise and user-friendly.

use ratatui crate and integrate minimal Terminal User Interface (TUI) for vtagemt. using the Ratatui crate (reference: https://docs.rs/ratatui/latest/ratatui/). The goal is to port the core logic from an existing CLI-based implementation—including the chat runloop, context management, and agent core logic—to a fully functional TUI version. Ensure a 1-to-1 port of functionality, followed by end-to-end testing to verify seamless operation, such as sending user inputs, processing agent responses, maintaining chat history, and handling intermediate states like tool calls and reasoning.

Key requirements:

-   **Simplicity and Minimality**: Focus on essential features: a chat display area for conversation history (including user messages, agent responses, tool calls, reasoning traces, action logs, and loading statuses), a minimal input field for user messages, and basic navigation (e.g., Enter to send, Esc to quit, arrow keys for scrolling history). Avoid unnecessary complexity; prioritize responsive, keyboard-driven interaction in a standard terminal environment.
-   **Enhanced UI Elements for Feedback**:
    -   Implement a loading UI/UX spinner (e.g., using Ratatui's spinning widget or a custom animated indicator) that appears immediately upon receiving a user message and persists while the model is executing or finishing tool calls.
    -   Provide real-time feedback by rendering action logs and traces in the TUI as they occur, ensuring the interface remains responsive during processing.
    -   Arrange message cells clearly: Display tool calls, reasoning steps, action logs, and loading statuses in distinct, compact sections within the chat area (e.g., using bordered blocks or paragraphs with timestamps/icons for visual separation), providing just enough information without overwhelming the layout—e.g., collapse verbose traces into expandable summaries if needed.
-   **Core Porting Steps**:
    1. Extract and adapt the CLI's chat runloop to handle TUI events (e.g., using Ratatui's event loop with Crossterm backend), integrating loading spinners and action log rendering for asynchronous agent processing.
    2. Port context and agent logic to integrate with TUI rendering, ensuring state persistence across renders, including real-time updates for tool calls, reasoning, and logs.
    3. Replace CLI output (e.g., println!) with Ratatui widgets for formatted display, handling ANSI escapes via the ansi-to-tui crate if needed, and extend to render dynamic elements like spinners and log traces.
-   **Testing**: Implement a comprehensive end-to-end test suite that simulates user interactions (e.g., typing messages, triggering agent replies, tool calls, and loading states) and validates output consistency with the original CLI behavior, including visual verification of spinners, logs, and message arrangements.

Incorporate and adapt code from the following resources for implementation:

-   **Ratatui Core**: Use as the foundation for TUI rendering and event handling (reference example implementations like codex-rs if available for chat-like UIs with dynamic updates).
-   **Input Handling Examples**:
    -   Input form: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/examples/apps/input-form (adapt for a single-line chat input with validation and Enter-to-send).
    -   User input: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/examples/apps/user-input (use for real-time keyboard input capture and editing, including Esc for quit).
-   **Templates and Best Practices**:
    -   Starter template: https://github.com/ratatui/templates (initialize project structure with a basic app loop supporting scrolling and state management).
    -   Awesome Ratatui: https://github.com/ratatui/awesome-ratatui (draw from community examples for chat layouts, scrolling lists, loading indicators, and log displays).
-   **Supporting Crates and Examples**:
    -   ANSI-to-TUI: https://github.com/ratatui/ansi-to-tui (integrate to render agent responses with colors/styles from existing CLI ANSI output, including traces and statuses).
    -   Widgets: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/ratatui-widgets/examples (leverage Paragraph for chat messages and logs, List for history scrolling, Block for borders/padding around message cells, and custom spinners for loading feedback).

encourage the agent to use curl with caution and security in mind, it should always validate URLs and avoid downloading untrusted content.

--

encourage the agent to use /tmp to store temporary files and clean them up after use.

integrates the Hotpath profiler (available at https://deepwiki.com/pawurb/hotpath), a lightweight tool for pinpointing exactly where your code spends its time
