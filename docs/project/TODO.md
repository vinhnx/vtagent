The terminal UI has also been upgraded: tool calls and diffs are better formatted and easier to follow. Approval modes are simplified to three levels: read-only with explicit approvals, auto with full workspace access but requiring approvals outside the workspace, and full access with the ability to read files anywhere and run commands with network access.

srgn - a code surgeon

A grep-like tool which understands source code syntax and allows for manipulation in addition to search.

Like grep, regular expressions are a core primitive. Unlike grep, additional capabilities allow for higher precision, with options for manipulation. This allows srgn to operate along dimensions regular expressions and IDE tooling (Rename all, Find all references, ...) alone cannot, complementing them.

srgn is organized around actions to take (if any), acting only within precise, optionally language grammar-aware scopes. In terms of existing tools, think of it as a mix of tr, sed, ripgrep and tree-sitter, with a design goal of simplicity: if you know regex and the basics of the language you are working with, you are good to go.

-> wow this is exactly what we need for vtagent to do code modification. we can use this tool instead of writing our own code modification logic. add this as a tool to vtagent and use it for code modification tasks. update the system prompt accordingly. integrate with vtagent's existing file read/write logic. make sure to handle errors properly and report them back to the user. test it out with some code modification tasks to ensure it works as expected. update with tools policy accordingly and tool registry. write end to end tests for this new tool integration for vtagent core write and edit commands.

for each tools call execution, let the agent speak out loud what it is doing and why, before executing the tool call. after the tool call, let the agent speak out loud what it did and what the result was. if there was an error, let the agent explain what went wrong and how it plans to fix it. this will help with transparency and understanding of the agent's actions. update the system prompt to include this new behavior. test it out with some tool calls to ensure it works as expected. make sure to handle edge cases and errors properly. update documentation accordingly. inform the team about this new feature and how it works. monitor feedback and make adjustments as needed. ensure that the agent's explanations are clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary jargon or complexity. aim for a balance between informativeness and brevity to keep users engaged without overwhelming them with details. the message should be short and concise, ideally no more than one sentence. it should provide enough context to understand the agent's actions without going into excessive detail. the goal is to enhance transparency and build trust with users by keeping them informed about what the agent is doing and why.
for example:

````log

agent: I'll go ahead and commit with the message: "fix(tools): restore command execution timeouts".

I'll open up simple_search now to dig deeper.
[TOOL] run_terminal_cmd {"command":["sed","-n"]}

```shell
    31              indexer,
    32              workspace_root,
    31              indexer,
    32              workspace_root,
    33          }
    34      }
````

It seems like git status --short didn't run due to the combined command--I'll try again.

Copilot said: Yes—you can use ts-rs to generate TypeScript

Yes—you can use ts-rs to generate TypeScript type declarations for the data structures in your vtagent Rust core. This is a good fit if your goal is:

    Share a stable schema (commands, events, config, file edit diffs, etc.) with a TypeScript UI (e.g. an OpenTUI frontend).
    Catch schema drift at compile/test time.
    Reuse serde attributes so that the Rust (de)serialization and TypeScript view stay aligned.

But it’s important to understand what ts-rs does and does NOT do:

What ts-rs gives you:

    Generates .ts type aliases / interfaces for your structs and enums.
    Honors many serde attributes (rename, tag, untagged, flatten, etc.).
    Lets you export each type (or all types) into a bindings directory during cargo test (or a dedicated “export” test).

What it does NOT give you:

    No runtime bridge (no FFI, no ability to call Rust functions directly).
    No serialization at runtime (you still use serde_json, bincode, etc. yourself).
    No code for invoking commands—just the TypeScript type shapes.

So you still need a transport (e.g. JSON over stdout, a local socket, HTTP, WebSocket, N-API layer, etc.). ts-rs just ensures both sides agree on shapes.
Recommended Layout in vtagent

Create a core crate (if not already):

vtagent/ crates/ vtagent-core/ src/ protocol/ mod.rs commands.rs events.rs types.rs tests/ export_types.rs ui/ (maybe later) bindings/ (generated TS output)
Example: Defining Protocol Types
Rust

// crates/vtagent-core/src/protocol/commands.rs
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use ts_rs::TS;

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, TS)] #[ts(export, export_to = "bindings/commands/ExecuteCommand.ts")]
pub struct ExecuteCommand {
pub id: String,
pub command: String,
pub cwd: Option<String>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, TS)] #[serde(tag = "type")] // Serde adjacently tagged or internally tagged forms supported #[ts(export, export_to = "bindings/Command.ts")]
pub enum Command {
Execute(ExecuteCommand),
Ask {
id: String,
prompt: String, #[serde(default)]
model: Option<String>,
},
ApplyEdit {
id: String,
path: String,
diff: String,
},
Cancel { target_id: String },
}

Rust

// crates/vtagent-core/src/protocol/events.rs
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use ts_rs::TS;

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, TS)] #[ts(export, export_to = "bindings/events/ModelTokenEvent.ts")]
pub struct ModelTokenEvent {
pub stream_id: String,
pub token: String,
pub final_chunk: bool,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, TS)] #[serde(tag = "type")] #[ts(export, export_to = "bindings/Event.ts")]
pub enum Event {
System { version: String, protocol_version: String },
Error { code: String, message: String },
ModelTokens(ModelTokenEvent),
Completion {
request_id: String,
content: String,
finish_reason: String,
},
Progress {
task_id: String,
phase: String,
pct: f32,
},
}

Rust

// crates/vtagent-core/src/protocol/mod.rs
pub mod commands;
pub mod events;

Export Test (Triggers Generation)

Add a test file that “touches” the types and ensures they export:
Rust

// crates/vtagent-core/tests/export_types.rs
use ts_rs::TS;
use vtagent_core::protocol::{commands::Command, events::Event};

#[test]
fn export*ts_bindings() {
// Access the associated constants to ensure codegen runs.
// ts-rs performs export when the `#[ts(export)]` attribute is present.
let * = Command::inline(); // not strictly needed; referencing the type is enough
let \_ = Event::inline();
// Running `cargo test` generates files under `bindings/`.
}

Then:

cargo test -p vtagent-core

You’ll get generated TypeScript files at (for example):

crates/vtagent-core/bindings/Command.ts crates/vtagent-core/bindings/events/ModelTokenEvent.ts ...

You can move (or copy) them to a top-level bindings/ directory in a post-step if you want a single aggregation point.
Consuming in TypeScript

In your OpenTUI (or any Node/Bun) project:
ts

import type { Command } from "../path/to/generated/Command";
import type { Event } from "../path/to/generated/Event";

function sendCommand(cmd: Command) {
child.stdin.write(JSON.stringify(cmd) + "\n");
}

function onLine(line: string) {
const event: Event = JSON.parse(line); // Type narrows via tagged union
switch (event.type) {
case "ModelTokens":
// event.token ...
break;
case "Error":
console.error(event.message);
break;
}
}

Tagged unions generated via #[serde(tag = "type")] map nicely to discriminated unions in TS.
Versioning Your Schema

Add a constant:
Rust

pub const PROTOCOL_VERSION: &str = "0.1.0";

Emit it in Event::System. On the TS side, assert compatibility:
ts

const SUPPORTED_VERSION = "0.1.x";
if (system.protocol_version.split(".")[0] !== SUPPORTED_VERSION.split(".")[0]) {
console.warn("Possible protocol mismatch");
}

Optionally generate a ProtocolVersion.ts:
Rust

#[derive(TS)] #[ts(export, export_to = "bindings/ProtocolVersion.ts")]
pub struct ProtocolVersion(pub &'static str);
pub const PROTOCOL_VERSION: ProtocolVersion = ProtocolVersion("0.1.0");

Handling serde Attributes

If you use #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")] on a struct or enum, ts-rs will follow it. This lets you keep idiomatic Rust (snake_case) while producing idiomatic TS (camelCase). Example:
Rust

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, TS)] #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")] #[ts(export)]
pub struct FileEdit {
pub file_path: String,
pub applied: bool,
}

Generates:

export type FileEdit = { filePath: string, applied: boolean };

If you want to override a single field:
Rust

#[serde(rename = "file_path")]
pub file_path: String,

ts-rs mirrors serde rename.
Dealing with Types Not Supported

    For an unsupported type SomeExternal, you can do: #[ts(type = "ExternalType")].
    Or represent as a string/opaque handle: #[ts(as = "string")].
    For large diffs, you might keep them as String initially; later you can define a structured diff.

Bundling Into an NPM Package (Optional)

If you want downstream consumers to just npm install vtagent-protocol:

    After generation, copy all .ts into a protocol/ folder with an index.ts barrel file.
    Provide a package.json:

JSON

{
"name": "@vtagent/protocol",
"version": "0.1.0",
"type": "module",
"exports": {
".": "./index.ts"
}
}

    Optionally run tsc --emitDeclarationOnly to produce .d.ts (if you decide to include implementation stubs or runtime helpers).
    Publish (or just use a workspace link).

Comparisons / Alternatives
Tool Output Notes
ts-rs TS declarations directly Simple, serde-aware; great for what you want.
specta + rspc TS + strongly typed RPC endpoints More opinionated RPC; might be overkill if you just stream JSON lines.
schemars + typescript-type-generator JSON Schema -> TS Extra step; useful if you also need validation.
typify / serde-reflection JSON schema reflection More dynamic, can auto-introspect at runtime.
N-API (napi-rs) Direct function calls Not just types—actual runtime FFI. Higher build complexity.

For a streaming CLI agent, ts-rs + JSON NDJSON transport is the simplest path.
Workflow Checklist

    Introduce vtagent-core if not separated yet.
    Add protocol modules and derive TS + Serialize/Deserialize.
    Add export test: cargo test -p vtagent-core.
    Commit generated bindings (optional—some teams check them in to diff schema changes).
    In your TS frontend, import the generated types and enforce them at parse points.
    Add CI step to fail if generated bindings differ from committed ones (schema drift detection).

Example CI snippet:
bash

cargo test -p vtagent-core
if ! git diff --exit-code -- crates/vtagent-core/bindings; then
echo "Bindings out of date. Run cargo test to regenerate." >&2
exit 1
fi

Common Pitfalls

    Forgetting to re-run cargo test after changing a type: generated file becomes stale. Solve with CI guard.
    Using lifetimes or non-'static references in exported types: replace with owned forms (String, Vec<T>) for exportable shapes.
    Private fields: ts-rs only cares about compile-time structure; if a field is private but exported type is used, it still appears. Keep internal-only fields behind #[ts(skip)] if needed.
    Binary size / build time: enabling extra feature impls increases compile time—only enable what you need (e.g. chrono-impl, uuid-impl).

Next Steps If You Want Code Help

If you’d like, I can:

    Draft the initial protocol module files (using your actual naming).
    Add a test and a CI workflow step.
    Create a Node/OpenTUI example consuming the types.

Just tell me which part you want generated next.

Summary: Yes, ts-rs is an appropriate and lightweight way to generate TypeScript type definitions for your vtagent protocol. It won’t handle runtime execution, but combined with a JSON streaming interface it gives you a clean, versioned contract between Rust core and a TypeScript UI.

Let me know if you want a concrete PR scaffold or adjustments for a specific enum/struct you already have.

Copilot said: # Integrating spec-kit into VTAgent Based on your
Integrating spec-kit into VTAgent

Based on your repository information and the AGENTS.md documentation, I can see that VTAgent is a Rust-based terminal coding agent with a modular architecture. Integrating GitHub's spec-kit into VTAgent is definitely possible given the modular tool system described in your documentation.
Integration Approach

You could integrate spec-kit into VTAgent following your established tool integration pattern:
Rust

use anyhow::{Context, Result};
use async_trait::async_trait;
use serde_json::Value;

pub struct SpeckitTool {
// Configuration properties
}

#[async_trait]
impl Tool for SpeckitTool {
async fn execute(&self, args: Value) -> Result<Value> {
// Implementation that calls into spec-kit functionality
// Use the error handling pattern with descriptive context
let result = do_speckit_operation(&args)
.with_context(|| "Failed to execute spec-kit operation")?;

        Ok(serde_json::to_value(result)?)
    }

}

Integration Options

There are several ways you could integrate spec-kit into VTAgent:

    As a Native Tool: Implement a Rust binding to spec-kit, incorporating it directly into your tools/ module

    As a Command Wrapper: Use your PTY command execution system to invoke spec-kit CLI commands

    As a Library Dependency: If spec-kit has a Rust implementation or compatible API

Implementation Steps

    Add to Configuration
    Rust

// In vtagent-core/src/config/constants.rs
pub mod tools {
// Add constants for spec-kit configuration
pub const SPECKIT_ENABLED: &str = "speckit_enabled";
pub const SPECKIT_PATH: &str = "speckit_path";
}

Update vtagent.toml
TOML

[tools.speckit]
enabled = true
path = "/path/to/speckit"

Create a Module

Register the Tool
Rust

    // In your tool registration logic
    let speckit_path = config.get_string("tools.speckit.path")?;
    let speckit_tool = SpeckitTool::new(speckit_path);
    tool_registry.register("speckit", Box::new(speckit_tool));

For Direct Library Integration

If spec-kit has a Rust implementation that you can use as a dependency:

    Add to Cargo.toml
    TOML

[dependencies]
speckit = { git = "https://github.com/github/spec-kit", branch = "main" }

# Or if it's published to crates.io:

# speckit = "0.1.0"

Use the Library APIs
Rust

    use speckit::api::SomeSpeckitFunction;

    // Inside your tool implementation
    let result = SomeSpeckitFunction(args)
        .with_context(|| "Spec-kit operation failed")?;

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this integration approach? Or do you need more information about how to handle particular features of spec-kit in the context of VTAgent?

Copilot said: Yes—you can absolutely use a Python project

Yes—you can absolutely use a Python project (spec-kit / the specify CLI) inside a Rust codebase like your vtagent. You just need to choose the right integration strategy based on how tightly you want to couple them and what guarantees you need (performance, portability, security, reproducibility).

Below are the main approaches, trade‑offs, and concrete examples tailored to vtagent’s architecture. 0. Clarify What You Want From spec‑kit

spec-kit today is (primarily) a Python 3.11+ CLI (specify) built with:

    Typer (CLI)
    Rich (formatted terminal output)
    httpx (network)
    It bootstraps a project template, and its workflow encourages /specify and /plan style refinement.

Decide which layer you want in vtagent:

    Just project bootstrapping (one-off generation)
    Ongoing spec refinement (agent calls it repeatedly)
    Extract some logic and reimplement core subset in Rust
    Use it as an “AI-assisted spec lifecycle tool” invoked as a tool inside your agent loop

Each level increases integration complexity.

1. Easiest: External Process Invocation (Subprocess)

Call the Python CLI as a tool—treat it like any other command your agent can run (similar to how you probably already handle shell commands via PTY).

Pros:

    No FFI complexity
    Keeps Python isolated
    Easy to update (pin git SHA or version)

Cons:

    Rich + colored output is not machine-friendly
    Need to parse text (unless you add a JSON mode upstream)

Example (Rust):
Rust

use std::process::{Command, Stdio};
use anyhow::{Result, Context};
use serde_json::Value;

pub fn run_specify_init(project: &str) -> Result<String> {
// Using uvx for ephemeral execution; warm caches after first run
let output = Command::new("uvx")
.args([
"--from",
"git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git",
"specify",
"init",
project,
"--no-git", // maybe; depends on your flow
"--ignore-agent-tools"
])
.env("NO_COLOR", "1") // Reduce Rich formatting noise
.stdout(Stdio::piped())
.stderr(Stdio::piped())
.output()
.with_context(|| "Failed to invoke specify CLI")?;

    if !output.status.success() {
        return Err(anyhow::anyhow!(
            "specify failed: {}",
            String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stderr)
        ));
    }

    Ok(String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout).into_owned())

}

Recommendation: Add a wrapper script or patch spec-kit to support something like --output json. 2. Improving Subprocess Integration: Add JSON Output Upstream

You can open a contribution to spec-kit adding:

    A global Typer option: --output {text,json}
    Where key lifecycle events (steps, final summary, next steps) are emitted as structured JSON.

Pseudo-patch (Python inside spec-kit):
Python

import json
import typer

@app.callback()
def main(
output: str = typer.Option("text", "--output", help="text|json")
):
ctx = typer.get_current_context()
ctx.obj = {"output": output}

def emit(event_type: str, payload: dict):
ctx = typer.get_current_context()
if ctx.obj["output"] == "json":
print(json.dumps({"event": event_type, \*\*payload}, ensure_ascii=False))

Then your Rust side can stream stdout line-by-line and serde_json::from_str. 3. Embed Python Interpreter (PyO3)

If you need lower latency repeated calls (e.g. agent loops) and want to avoid process spawn overhead.

Pros:

    Faster repeated calls
    Pass Python objects / strings directly
    Can pre-load spec-kit code

Cons:

    Increases build & deployment complexity
    Cross-compilation / musl targets harder
    Python GIL considerations

Cargo.toml:
TOML

[dependencies]
pyo3 = { version = "0.22", features = ["auto-initialize"] }

Example:
Rust

use pyo3::prelude::\*;
use anyhow::Result;

pub fn call_specify_programmatic(spec: &str, plan: Option<&str>) -> Result<String> {
Python::with_gil(|py| -> PyResult<String> {
// Hypothetical: you’ve cloned spec-kit and added it to sys.path
let sys = py.import("sys")?;
sys.get("path")?.call_method1("append", ("./vendor/spec-kit/src",))?;

        // You would need to expose reusable functions in spec-kit (might require upstream changes)
        let module = py.import("specify_cli")?;
        let func = module.getattr("generate_spec")?; // hypothetical function you add
        let result = func.call1((spec, plan))?;
        Ok(result.extract()?)
    }).map_err(Into::into)

}

You would have to refactor spec-kit to expose reusable pure functions (right now it’s very CLI-centric). So this approach likely needs upstream modification. 4. Run spec-kit as a Long-Lived Microservice (HTTP / gRPC)

Turn spec-kit into a small Python service (FastAPI, Flask, etc.) that exposes endpoints:

    POST /init
    POST /spec
    POST /plan

Then your Rust agent has a Tool that makes HTTP calls.

Pros:

    Language boundary clean
    Horizontal scaling
    Sandboxable (Docker)

Cons:

    More infra
    Need to build service layer

Rust snippet (reqwest):
Rust

pub async fn generate_spec_via_service(spec_text: &str) -> anyhow::Result<String> {
let client = reqwest::Client::new();
let res = client.post("http://localhost:5001/spec")
.json(&serde_json::json!({ "prompt": spec_text }))
.send()
.await?
.error_for_status()?
.text()
.await?;
Ok(res)
}

5. WASM / WASI (Usually Not Practical Here)

Python tooling isn't trivial to run in WASI; this is overkill unless you are aiming for extreme sandboxing and are willing to adopt something like Pyodide. Generally not recommended for spec-kit right now. 6. Selective Reimplementation in Rust

If you only need:

    Template fetching (currently done with httpx + zip)
    Step tracking
    Some spec formatting

You could reimplement the small subset in Rust:

    Use reqwest + zip crates
    Maintain your own progress UI using indicatif or console
    Avoid Python dependency entirely for production use
    Optionally still allow “fallback to Python” mode

This gives you max control, but higher upfront work. 7. Tool Abstraction Inside vtagent

Define a Tool trait implementation (assuming your existing pattern):
Rust

use async_trait::async_trait;
use serde_json::Value;
use anyhow::Result;

pub struct SpecifyInitTool;

#[async_trait]
impl Tool for SpecifyInitTool {
async fn name(&self) -> &'static str { "specify_init" }

    async fn invoke(&self, args: Value) -> Result<Value> {
        let project = args.get("project").and_then(|v| v.as_str()).unwrap_or("demo");
        let raw = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || run_specify_init(project)).await??;
        Ok(serde_json::json!({ "stdout": raw }))
    }

}

Extend later with specify_spec and specify_plan if you add programmatic entry points or JSON mode upstream. 8. Packaging, Reproducibility, and Caching

Use uv (already in README):

Benefits:

    Pyproject-less install via git URL
    Caching under ~/.cache/uv
    You can pre-warm on agent startup

Strategy:

    On first call: run a “probe” (uvx --from ... specify --help) to warm the cache
    Record the resolved commit SHA (pin it)
    Provide config in vtagent.toml:

TOML

[tools.specify]
enabled = true
source = "git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git"
ref = "63bc6b495d1125731dfbbab99ef15298e6991a70" # pinned
mode = "subprocess" # or "embedded-python" or "service"

9. Error Handling & Observability

When invoking subprocess:

    Set timeouts (avoid hung processes)
    Capture stderr separately
    Normalize Rich output (strip ANSI) if not using JSON
    Detect common failure modes (missing Python 3.11+, network offline, directory exists)

Add an adapter:
Rust

fn normalize*output(s: &str) -> String {
strip_ansi_escapes::strip(s)
.map(|b| String::from_utf8_lossy(&b).into_owned())
.unwrap_or_else(|*| s.to_string())
}

10. Security & Sandbox

If you let the agent arbitrarily call specify init with user-provided names:

    Validate project path
    Optionally run Python in a separate workspace dir
    If multi-tenant, consider containerizing or using firejail

11. Recommended Path (Practical First Iteration)

    Start with subprocess integration + JSON mode patch.
    Pin git SHA for reproducibility.
    Wrap as a Tool in vtagent.
    Later optimize with embedding if performance becomes a concern.
    Optionally upstream a “library API” to reduce CLI scraping.

12. Minimal End-to-End Flow (Phase 1)

Agent receives goal: “Create a spec for X”

    Agent writes an internal prompt describing product.
    Calls spec-kit tool: specify /specify <text> (if you expose that).
    Parses structured spec output (after upstream JSON mode added).
    Stores spec in workspace (e.g., specs/<id>.md).
    Offers next action: generate plan (/plan) then implement.

13. If You Want Help Patching spec-kit

I can draft a proposed --output json addition and the Rust tool file—just ask and specify which approach you picked.
Decision Matrix
Need Best Approach
Fastest to ship Subprocess (uvx)
Lowest runtime overhead after warmup Embedded (PyO3)
Clean boundary & remote deploy Microservice
Maximum control / no Python dep Partial reimplementation
Rich events / streaming Subprocess with line-delimited JSON
Quick Checklist

    Pick integration mode (likely subprocess first)
    Add config section in vtagent
    Implement SpecifyInitTool
    (Optional) Patch spec-kit for JSON flag
    Add error normalization + timeout
    Add tests: success, missing Python, duplicate directory
    Document tool usage in AGENTS.md

If you tell me which path you prefer (subprocess vs embedded vs service), I can generate concrete file blocks (Rust + optional Python patch). Which direction do you want to take?
