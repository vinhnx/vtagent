Interactive chat (tools)
Model: gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17
Workspace: /Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/vtagent
Detected languages: JavaScript:1, Python:1, Rust:160

Welcome! I preloaded workspace context so we can hit the ground running.

Project context:

-   Project: vtagent v0.4.2
-   Root: /Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/vtagent

Languages detected:

-   JavaScript:1, Python:1, Rust:160

Guideline highlights:

-   **Workspace Structure**: `vtagent-core/` (library) + `src/` (binary) with modular tools system
-   **Core Modules**: `llm/` (provider abstraction), `tools/` (modular tool system), `config/` (TOML-based settings)
-   **Integration Points**: Gemini API, tree-sitter parsers, PTY command execution, MCP tools
-   **Primary Config**: `vtagent.toml` (never hardcode settings)

How to work together:

-   Share the outcome you need or ask for a quick /status summary.
-   Reference AGENTS.md expectations before changing files.
-   Prefer focused tool calls (read_file, grep_search) before editing.

Recommended next actions:

-   Request a workspace orientation or describe the task you want to tackle.
-   Confirm priorities or blockers so I can suggest next steps.

Type 'exit' to quit, 'help' for commands
Suggested input: Describe your next coding goal (e.g., "analyze router config")

--> revise welcome message to make it more concise and user-friendly.

use ratatui crate and integrate minimal Terminal User Interface (TUI) for vtagemt. using the Ratatui crate (reference: https://docs.rs/ratatui/latest/ratatui/). The goal is to port the core logic from an existing CLI-based implementation—including the chat runloop, context management, and agent core logic—to a fully functional TUI version. Ensure a 1-to-1 port of functionality, followed by end-to-end testing to verify seamless operation, such as sending user inputs, processing agent responses, maintaining chat history, and handling intermediate states like tool calls and reasoning.

Key requirements:

-   **Simplicity and Minimality**: Focus on essential features: a chat display area for conversation history (including user messages, agent responses, tool calls, reasoning traces, action logs, and loading statuses), a minimal input field for user messages, and basic navigation (e.g., Enter to send, Esc to quit, arrow keys for scrolling history). Avoid unnecessary complexity; prioritize responsive, keyboard-driven interaction in a standard terminal environment.
-   **Enhanced UI Elements for Feedback**:
    -   Implement a loading UI/UX spinner (e.g., using Ratatui's spinning widget or a custom animated indicator) that appears immediately upon receiving a user message and persists while the model is executing or finishing tool calls.
    -   Provide real-time feedback by rendering action logs and traces in the TUI as they occur, ensuring the interface remains responsive during processing.
    -   Arrange message cells clearly: Display tool calls, reasoning steps, action logs, and loading statuses in distinct, compact sections within the chat area (e.g., using bordered blocks or paragraphs with timestamps/icons for visual separation), providing just enough information without overwhelming the layout—e.g., collapse verbose traces into expandable summaries if needed.
-   **Core Porting Steps**:
    1. Extract and adapt the CLI's chat runloop to handle TUI events (e.g., using Ratatui's event loop with Crossterm backend), integrating loading spinners and action log rendering for asynchronous agent processing.
    2. Port context and agent logic to integrate with TUI rendering, ensuring state persistence across renders, including real-time updates for tool calls, reasoning, and logs.
    3. Replace CLI output (e.g., println!) with Ratatui widgets for formatted display, handling ANSI escapes via the ansi-to-tui crate if needed, and extend to render dynamic elements like spinners and log traces.
-   **Testing**: Implement a comprehensive end-to-end test suite that simulates user interactions (e.g., typing messages, triggering agent replies, tool calls, and loading states) and validates output consistency with the original CLI behavior, including visual verification of spinners, logs, and message arrangements.

Incorporate and adapt code from the following resources for implementation:

-   **Ratatui Core**: Use as the foundation for TUI rendering and event handling (reference example implementations like codex-rs if available for chat-like UIs with dynamic updates).
-   **Input Handling Examples**:
    -   Input form: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/examples/apps/input-form (adapt for a single-line chat input with validation and Enter-to-send).
    -   User input: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/examples/apps/user-input (use for real-time keyboard input capture and editing, including Esc for quit).
-   **Templates and Best Practices**:
    -   Starter template: https://github.com/ratatui/templates (initialize project structure with a basic app loop supporting scrolling and state management).
    -   Awesome Ratatui: https://github.com/ratatui/awesome-ratatui (draw from community examples for chat layouts, scrolling lists, loading indicators, and log displays).
-   **Supporting Crates and Examples**:
    -   ANSI-to-TUI: https://github.com/ratatui/ansi-to-tui (integrate to render agent responses with colors/styles from existing CLI ANSI output, including traces and statuses).
    -   Widgets: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/ratatui-widgets/examples (leverage Paragraph for chat messages and logs, List for history scrolling, Block for borders/padding around message cells, and custom spinners for loading feedback).

Enable the agent to operate within and interact with a provided input workspace. The agent must have full capabilities to read, write, and modify files in the workspace; execute shell commands and scripts within it; and gather contextual information by performing project indexing, such as scanning directories, analyzing file structures, and extracting metadata to build an index of the project's contents. By default, the agent should treat the workspace as its primary context for all operations, ensuring that any actions taken are relevant to the files and structure present in the workspace. For example, if the agent is tasked with adding a new feature, it should first analyze the existing codebase within the workspace to understand its architecture and dependencies before making any changes. This approach ensures that the agent's actions are informed by the current state of the project, leading to more coherent and contextually appropriate modifications. Default, the environment variable WORKSPACE_DIR is set to the path of the workspace directory, and the agent should use this variable to reference the workspace in its operations. Update system prompt to reflect these capabilities and provide guidance on how to effectively utilize the workspace context in various scenarios. Update document, readme and guides to reflect this new capability.

Status 2025-09-18: System prompt, README, docs/README.md, and user-guide updates now document the workspace-first capabilities and `WORKSPACE_DIR` usage.

Let's get oriented. I preloaded workspace context so we can move fast.

Project context:

-   Root: /Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/vtchat

Guideline highlights:

-   **Monorepo**: Turborepo-managed, with `apps/` (main: Next.js web app) and `packages/` (shared code: `common`, `shared`, `ai`, `ui`, etc.).
-   **Core Technologies**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19.0.0, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Zustand, Drizzle ORM (Neon PostgreSQL), Better-Auth, Framer Motion, Lucide icons.
-   **AI/Agents**: Agentic Graph System in `packages/ai/` (supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, etc.).

How to work together:

-   Describe your current coding goal or ask for a quick status overview.
-   Reference AGENTS.md guidelines when proposing changes.
-   Prefer asking for targeted file reads or diffs before editing.

Recommended next actions:

-   Review the highlighted guidelines and share the task you want to tackle.
-   Ask for a workspace tour if you need more context.

-> fix: Warning: Failed to initialize tool policy manager: Failed to parse tool policy config

-   2025-09-18: Tool policy loader now resets invalid JSON to defaults (with backup) instead of warning on every launch.

explore and use parking_lot for better performance in multithreaded scenarios. Replace standard library synchronization primitives (like Mutex and RwLock) with their parking_lot counterparts where appropriate. Ensure that the transition maintains thread safety and correctness while improving performance. Update documentation to reflect the use of parking_lot and any changes in synchronization behavior.

-   `/command <program> [args...]` — run a shell command via `run_terminal_cmd`
    --> also add "!" to toggle command and normal mode.

press ! -> command mode
press ! again -> normal mode.

note:

-   on command mode only execute `run_terminal_cmd` only no tool call
-   on normal mode, full chat agent loop with tools call
-   on command mode, update the info and visual of the repl
