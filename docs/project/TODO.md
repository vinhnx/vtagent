A simple Rust profiler that shows exactly where your code spends time

--

Use Rust's Clippy linter to thoroughly scan the entire codebase for dead code, unused variables, unreachable code, and similar inefficiencies. Review all warnings and suggestions in detail, prioritizing high-impact issues. Then, systematically fix the identified problems by removing or refactoring the dead code, ensuring the changes maintain functionality, pass all tests, and improve code quality without introducing new issues. Provide a summary of changes made.

srgn - a code surgeon

A grep-like tool which understands source code syntax and allows for manipulation in addition to search.

Like grep, regular expressions are a core primitive. Unlike grep, additional capabilities allow for higher precision, with options for manipulation. This allows srgn to operate along dimensions regular expressions and IDE tooling (Rename all, Find all references, ...) alone cannot, complementing them.

srgn is organized around actions to take (if any), acting only within precise, optionally language grammar-aware scopes. In terms of existing tools, think of it as a mix of tr, sed, ripgrep and tree-sitter, with a design goal of simplicity: if you know regex and the basics of the language you are working with, you are good to go.

-> wow this is exactly what we need for vtagent to do code modification. we can use this tool instead of writing our own code modification logic. add this as a tool to vtagent and use it for code modification tasks. update the system prompt accordingly. integrate with vtagent's existing file read/write logic. make sure to handle errors properly and report them back to the user. test it out with some code modification tasks to ensure it works as expected. update with tools policy accordingly and tool registry. write end to end tests for this new tool integration for vtagent core write and edit commands.

IMPORTANT: check for comment "// For now..." and remove those comments and implement the missing functionality. make sure to test the new functionality thoroughly. make sure to cover edge cases and handle errors gracefully. update documentation accordingly. run all existing tests to ensure nothing is broken. if any tests fail, fix the issues before proceeding. once everything is working, commit the changes with a clear message describing what was implemented and why. update the system prompt to reflect the new functionality. inform the team about the changes made and any new features added. ensure that the code is clean and follows best practices. review the code for any potential improvements or optimizations. once satisfied, push the changes to the repository and create a pull request for review. monitor the pull request for feedback and make any necessary adjustments based on the review comments. once approved, merge the changes into the main branch and deploy if applicable. finally, update any relevant project management tools or documentation to reflect the new functionality and its impact on the project.

for each tools call execution, let the agent speak out loud what it is doing and why, before executing the tool call. after the tool call, let the agent speak out loud what it did and what the result was. if there was an error, let the agent explain what went wrong and how it plans to fix it. this will help with transparency and understanding of the agent's actions. update the system prompt to include this new behavior. test it out with some tool calls to ensure it works as expected. make sure to handle edge cases and errors properly. update documentation accordingly. inform the team about this new feature and how it works. monitor feedback and make adjustments as needed. ensure that the agent's explanations are clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary jargon or complexity. aim for a balance between informativeness and brevity to keep users engaged without overwhelming them with details. the message should be short and concise, ideally no more than one sentence. it should provide enough context to understand the agent's actions without going into excessive detail. the goal is to enhance transparency and build trust with users by keeping them informed about what the agent is doing and why.
for example:

````log

agent: I'll go ahead and commit with the message: "fix(tools): restore command execution timeouts".

I'll open up simple_search now to dig deeper.
[TOOL] run_terminal_cmd {"command":["sed","-n"]}

```shell
    31              indexer,
    32              workspace_root,
    31              indexer,
    32              workspace_root,
    33          }
    34      }
````

It seems like git status --short didn't run due to the combined command--I'll try again.
[TOOL] run_terminal_cmd {"command":["git status","-short"]}

```shell
    31              indexer,
    32              workspace_root,
    33          }
    34      }
```

check for command execution failures and handle them gracefully. if a command fails, the agent should explain what went wrong and either retry the command or ask for clarification from the user. update the system prompt to include this new behavior. test it out with some failing commands to ensure it works as expected. make sure to handle edge cases and errors properly. update documentation accordingly. inform the team about this new feature and how it works. monitor feedback and make adjustments as needed. ensure that the agent's explanations are clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary jargon or complexity. aim for a balance between informativeness and brevity to keep users engaged without overwhelming them with details. the message should be short and concise, ideally no more than one sentence. it should provide enough context to understand the agent's actions without going into excessive detail. the goal is to enhance transparency and build trust with users by keeping them informed about what the agent is doing and why.

turn 1:

```
> run pty git status
[TOOL] run_terminal_cmd {"command":"git status","mode":"pty"}
I'm sorry, but I cannot use the 'pty' mode for the `run_terminal_cmd` tool as it is not allowed by the policy. I can use the 'terminal' mode. Would you like me to run `git status` using the 'terminal' mode?
```

turn 2:

> yes
> [TOOL] run_terminal_cmd {"command":"git status","mode":"terminal"}
> Provider error: API error 500 Internal Server Error: {
> "error": {

    "code": 500,
    "message": "An internal error has occurred. Please retry or report in https://developers.generativeai.google/guide/troubleshooting",
    "status": "INTERNAL"

}
}
-> seems like the command is not being executed properly, with simple following up user prompt "yes". but on second prompt explicit tell the agent to run the command "git status --short" again.

turn 3:

> run git status
> [TOOL] run_terminal_cmd {"command":["git","status"],"mode":"terminal"}
> [stdout]
> On branch codex/run-clippy-and-fix-code-issues
> Your branch is up to date with 'origin/codex/run-clippy-and-fix-code-issues'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
I've checked the git status, and it looks like you have a clean working tree with nothing to commit.

===> so the agent should be able to handle such cases where the command fails and retry or ask for clarification. update the system prompt to include this new behavior. test it out with some failing commands to ensure it works as expected. make sure to handle edge cases and errors properly. update documentation accordingly. inform the team about this new feature and how it works. monitor feedback and make adjustments as needed. ensure that the agent's explanations are clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary jargon or complexity. aim for a balance between informativeness and brevity to keep users engaged without overwhelming them with details. the message should be short and concise, ideally no more than one sentence. it should provide enough context to understand the agent's actions without going into excessive detail. the goal is to enhance transparency and build trust with users by keeping them informed about what the agent is doing and why.
