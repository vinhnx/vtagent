use ratatui crate and integrate minimal Terminal User Interface (TUI) for vtagemt. using the Ratatui crate (reference: https://docs.rs/ratatui/latest/ratatui/). The goal is to port the core logic from an existing CLI-based implementation—including the chat runloop, context management, and agent core logic—to a fully functional TUI version. Ensure a 1-to-1 port of functionality, followed by end-to-end testing to verify seamless operation, such as sending user inputs, processing agent responses, maintaining chat history, and handling intermediate states like tool calls and reasoning.

Key requirements:

-   **Simplicity and Minimality**: Focus on essential features: a chat display area for conversation history (including user messages, agent responses, tool calls, reasoning traces, action logs, and loading statuses), a minimal input field for user messages, and basic navigation (e.g., Enter to send, Esc to quit, arrow keys for scrolling history). Avoid unnecessary complexity; prioritize responsive, keyboard-driven interaction in a standard terminal environment.
-   **Enhanced UI Elements for Feedback**:
    -   Implement a loading UI/UX spinner (e.g., using Ratatui's spinning widget or a custom animated indicator) that appears immediately upon receiving a user message and persists while the model is executing or finishing tool calls.
    -   Provide real-time feedback by rendering action logs and traces in the TUI as they occur, ensuring the interface remains responsive during processing.
    -   Arrange message cells clearly: Display tool calls, reasoning steps, action logs, and loading statuses in distinct, compact sections within the chat area (e.g., using bordered blocks or paragraphs with timestamps/icons for visual separation), providing just enough information without overwhelming the layout—e.g., collapse verbose traces into expandable summaries if needed.
-   **Core Porting Steps**:
    1. Extract and adapt the CLI's chat runloop to handle TUI events (e.g., using Ratatui's event loop with Crossterm backend), integrating loading spinners and action log rendering for asynchronous agent processing.
    2. Port context and agent logic to integrate with TUI rendering, ensuring state persistence across renders, including real-time updates for tool calls, reasoning, and logs.
    3. Replace CLI output (e.g., println!) with Ratatui widgets for formatted display, handling ANSI escapes via the ansi-to-tui crate if needed, and extend to render dynamic elements like spinners and log traces.
-   **Testing**: Implement a comprehensive end-to-end test suite that simulates user interactions (e.g., typing messages, triggering agent replies, tool calls, and loading states) and validates output consistency with the original CLI behavior, including visual verification of spinners, logs, and message arrangements.

Incorporate and adapt code from the following resources for implementation:

-   **Ratatui Core**: Use as the foundation for TUI rendering and event handling (reference example implementations like codex-rs if available for chat-like UIs with dynamic updates).
-   **Input Handling Examples**:
    -   Input form: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/examples/apps/input-form (adapt for a single-line chat input with validation and Enter-to-send).
    -   User input: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/examples/apps/user-input (use for real-time keyboard input capture and editing, including Esc for quit).
-   **Templates and Best Practices**:
    -   Starter template: https://github.com/ratatui/templates (initialize project structure with a basic app loop supporting scrolling and state management).
    -   Awesome Ratatui: https://github.com/ratatui/awesome-ratatui (draw from community examples for chat layouts, scrolling lists, loading indicators, and log displays).
-   **Supporting Crates and Examples**:
    -   ANSI-to-TUI: https://github.com/ratatui/ansi-to-tui (integrate to render agent responses with colors/styles from existing CLI ANSI output, including traces and statuses).
    -   Widgets: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/ratatui-widgets/examples (leverage Paragraph for chat messages and logs, List for history scrolling, Block for borders/padding around message cells, and custom spinners for loading feedback).

encourage the agent to use curl with caution and security in mind, it should always validate URLs and avoid downloading untrusted content.

--

encourage the agent to use /tmp to store temporary files and clean them up after use.

integrates the Hotpath profiler (available at https://deepwiki.com/pawurb/hotpath), a lightweight tool for pinpointing exactly where your code spends its time

rename vtagent to vtcode

bump core? vtagent-core

--

distribute cargo, brew, and npm package managers to release.

explore and use parking_lot for better performance in multithreaded scenarios. Replace standard library synchronization primitives (like Mutex and RwLock) with their parking_lot counterparts where appropriate. Ensure that the transition maintains thread safety and correctness while improving performance. Update documentation to reflect the use of parking_lot and any changes in synchronization behavior.

check max tool call limit and handle it gracefully. it seems the agent stop calling tool after several steps?

add --full-auto mode, where the agent can run without any user intervention, including tool permission requests. This mode should be used with caution, as it allows the agent to make decisions autonomously. Ensure that users are aware of the risks and provide clear documentation on how to use this mode safely. Consider implementing additional safeguards, such as limiting the types of tools that can be used in full-auto mode or requiring a specific configuration file that outlines acceptable behaviors. full approve of tool calls.

Status: Implemented via the new `--full-auto` flag (see docs/guides/full_auto_mode.md for safeguards and usage).

check dead code: vtagent-core/src/core/agent/runner.rs

I reached the configured tool-call limit of 30 for this turn and paused further tool execution. Increase `tools.max_tool_loops` in vtagent.toml if you need more, then ask me to continue.

-> remove VTAGENT_MAX_TOOL_LOOPS env, and read from vtagent.toml only.

✓ Allow the agent to use 'read_file'? · yes
✓ Approved: 'read_file' tool will run now
[TOOL] list_files {"path":"packages/ai"}

tool call policy doesn't seem to work, it keeps asking for permission even I already approve it. Check and fix it.
