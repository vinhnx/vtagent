A simple Rust profiler that shows exactly where your code spends time

--

Use Rust's Clippy linter to thoroughly scan the entire codebase for dead code, unused variables, unreachable code, and similar inefficiencies. Review all warnings and suggestions in detail, prioritizing high-impact issues. Then, systematically fix the identified problems by removing or refactoring the dead code, ensuring the changes maintain functionality, pass all tests, and improve code quality without introducing new issues. Provide a summary of changes made.

srgn - a code surgeon

A grep-like tool which understands source code syntax and allows for manipulation in addition to search.

Like grep, regular expressions are a core primitive. Unlike grep, additional capabilities allow for higher precision, with options for manipulation. This allows srgn to operate along dimensions regular expressions and IDE tooling (Rename all, Find all references, ...) alone cannot, complementing them.

srgn is organized around actions to take (if any), acting only within precise, optionally language grammar-aware scopes. In terms of existing tools, think of it as a mix of tr, sed, ripgrep and tree-sitter, with a design goal of simplicity: if you know regex and the basics of the language you are working with, you are good to go.

-> wow this is exactly what we need for vtagent to do code modification. we can use this tool instead of writing our own code modification logic. add this as a tool to vtagent and use it for code modification tasks. update the system prompt accordingly. integrate with vtagent's existing file read/write logic. make sure to handle errors properly and report them back to the user. test it out with some code modification tasks to ensure it works as expected. update with tools policy accordingly and tool registry. write end to end tests for this new tool integration for vtagent core write and edit commands.

IMPORTANT: check for comment "// For now..." and remove those comments and implement the missing functionality. make sure to test the new functionality thoroughly. make sure to cover edge cases and handle errors gracefully. update documentation accordingly. run all existing tests to ensure nothing is broken. if any tests fail, fix the issues before proceeding. once everything is working, commit the changes with a clear message describing what was implemented and why. update the system prompt to reflect the new functionality. inform the team about the changes made and any new features added. ensure that the code is clean and follows best practices. review the code for any potential improvements or optimizations. once satisfied, push the changes to the repository and create a pull request for review. monitor the pull request for feedback and make any necessary adjustments based on the review comments. once approved, merge the changes into the main branch and deploy if applicable. finally, update any relevant project management tools or documentation to reflect the new functionality and its impact on the project.
