use ratatui crate and integrate minimal Terminal User Interface (TUI) for vtagemt. using the Ratatui crate (reference: https://docs.rs/ratatui/latest/ratatui/). The goal is to port the core logic from an existing CLI-based implementation—including the chat runloop, context management, and agent core logic—to a fully functional TUI version. Ensure a 1-to-1 port of functionality, followed by end-to-end testing to verify seamless operation, such as sending user inputs, processing agent responses, maintaining chat history, and handling intermediate states like tool calls and reasoning.

Key requirements:

-   **Simplicity and Minimality**: Focus on essential features: a chat display area for conversation history (including user messages, agent responses, tool calls, reasoning traces, action logs, and loading statuses), a minimal input field for user messages, and basic navigation (e.g., Enter to send, Esc to quit, arrow keys for scrolling history). Avoid unnecessary complexity; prioritize responsive, keyboard-driven interaction in a standard terminal environment.
-   **Enhanced UI Elements for Feedback**:
    -   Implement a loading UI/UX spinner (e.g., using Ratatui's spinning widget or a custom animated indicator) that appears immediately upon receiving a user message and persists while the model is executing or finishing tool calls.
    -   Provide real-time feedback by rendering action logs and traces in the TUI as they occur, ensuring the interface remains responsive during processing.
    -   Arrange message cells clearly: Display tool calls, reasoning steps, action logs, and loading statuses in distinct, compact sections within the chat area (e.g., using bordered blocks or paragraphs with timestamps/icons for visual separation), providing just enough information without overwhelming the layout—e.g., collapse verbose traces into expandable summaries if needed.
-   **Core Porting Steps**:
    1. Extract and adapt the CLI's chat runloop to handle TUI events (e.g., using Ratatui's event loop with Crossterm backend), integrating loading spinners and action log rendering for asynchronous agent processing.
    2. Port context and agent logic to integrate with TUI rendering, ensuring state persistence across renders, including real-time updates for tool calls, reasoning, and logs.
    3. Replace CLI output (e.g., println!) with Ratatui widgets for formatted display, handling ANSI escapes via the ansi-to-tui crate if needed, and extend to render dynamic elements like spinners and log traces.
-   **Testing**: Implement a comprehensive end-to-end test suite that simulates user interactions (e.g., typing messages, triggering agent replies, tool calls, and loading states) and validates output consistency with the original CLI behavior, including visual verification of spinners, logs, and message arrangements.

Incorporate and adapt code from the following resources for implementation:

-   **Ratatui Core**: Use as the foundation for TUI rendering and event handling (reference example implementations like codex-rs if available for chat-like UIs with dynamic updates).
-   **Input Handling Examples**:
    -   Input form: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/examples/apps/input-form (adapt for a single-line chat input with validation and Enter-to-send).
    -   User input: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/examples/apps/user-input (use for real-time keyboard input capture and editing, including Esc for quit).
-   **Templates and Best Practices**:
    -   Starter template: https://github.com/ratatui/templates (initialize project structure with a basic app loop supporting scrolling and state management).
    -   Awesome Ratatui: https://github.com/ratatui/awesome-ratatui (draw from community examples for chat layouts, scrolling lists, loading indicators, and log displays).
-   **Supporting Crates and Examples**:
    -   ANSI-to-TUI: https://github.com/ratatui/ansi-to-tui (integrate to render agent responses with colors/styles from existing CLI ANSI output, including traces and statuses).
    -   Widgets: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/ratatui-widgets/examples (leverage Paragraph for chat messages and logs, List for history scrolling, Block for borders/padding around message cells, and custom spinners for loading feedback).

encourage the agent to use curl with caution and security in mind, it should always validate URLs and avoid downloading untrusted content.

--

encourage the agent to use /tmp to store temporary files and clean them up after use.

--

✓ Allow the agent to use 'read_file'? · yes
✓ Approved: 'read_file' tool will run now
[TOOL] list_files {"path":"packages/ai"}

tool call policy doesn't seem to work, it keeps asking for permission even I already approve it. Check and fix it.

Summary of AMA with the Codex Team on Reddit on 2025-09-17

Internal Usage & Team Workflow

-   Team members use Codex to build Codex itself, with designers directly merging PRs and one engineer using it for 99% of their changes to Codex specifically, with goal of not typing single line of code by hand next year

-   Product team members use Codex for languages they're not strong in like Rust, often starting tasks on mobile between meetings then using VS Code extension to pull down work

-   Engineers prototype large features with ~5 turns of prompting to build multiple versions quickly and understand scope, using mix of CLI and VS Code extension to parallelize work and review code snippets in real time

-   Team uses it for one-off internal tools, visualization, monitoring, training data generation, and designer splits time 70/30 between Codex and design tooling to reduce gap between idea and execution

Platform Availability & Technical Limitations

-   Available through homebrew, npm, and direct binary downloads from GitHub releases, with plans to improve Windows support but no PyPi package available due to significant work required for every package manager

-   Would love to support more IDEs like JetBrains but huge amount of work remains on core experience

-   The team is shipping UI improvements but acknowledges terminal output readability issues, as different terminals render outputs differently - more improvements are coming

Usage Limits & Pricing Structure

-   Product lacks UI to show approaching limits which team is working to improve

-   Rate limits reset every 5 hours and weekly

-   No free tier available and no current plans for mid-tier between Plus and Pro though many users request one

-   Batch API-style usage for Codex web during unused GPU capacity discussed as great idea but not prioritized

Model Capabilities & Configuration

-   GPT-5-Codex model is specifically optimized for coding tasks with focused training on diverse coding environments, making separate specialized models for frontend/backend potentially unnecessary since coding tasks span multiple domains

-   Works well with large codebases using grep instead of dedicated indexing, can be prompted to work longer/faster and produce multi-page detailed implementation plans with different specification levels

-   Codex web chooses best configuration for tasks without allowing model or reasoning selection

-   GPT-5-high recommended for planning with more general world knowledge, GPT-5-Codex for technical refactors

-   No plans to allow system prompt editing though users can modify AGENTS[.]md for coding-adjacent tasks like data analysis or non-coding tasks

Features & User Experience

-   CLI supports web search with --search flag coming to IDE extension soon with prompt caching issues being resolved, potentially with full browser automation in the future

-   VS Code extension supports drag & drop when holding shift key, has auto context feature and enables mixing local and cloud work

-   File tagging with @ requested for folders not just individual files

-   Voice mode for terminal/IDE interaction - team would find it very cool to provide native support after seeing exciting open source community demos hacking together voice and coding agents

-   Can try local models with ollama using --oss flag though not first-class experience yet, with any future gpt-oss versions expected to work much better than current 20B model

Planning & Agent Development

-   Currently has Chat/Plan mode in IDE extension and read-only mode in CLI, working on dedicated plan mode with team landing on giving users more control over execution rather than having model do its own planning

-   Sub-agents are a fantastic way of preserving context for longer complex tasks but nothing actively being worked on right now

-   Conversation compacting for longer work coming soon and users able to ask Codex to create plans in markdown files for review and editing, with ability to prompt for multi-page documents where model will work for extended periods

content:

User: You will be acting as an AI career coach named Joe created by the company AdAstra Careers. Your goal is to give career advice to users. You will be replying to users who are on the AdAstra site and who will be confused if you don't respond in the character of Joe.

You should maintain a friendly customer service tone.

Here is the career guidance document you should reference when giving the user guidance: [DOCUMENT] </guidance>

Here are some important rules for the interaction:

    Always stay in character as Joe, an AI from AdAstra careers.
    If you are unsure how to respond, say "Sorry, I didn't understand that. Could you repeat the question?"
    If someone asks something irrelevant, say "Sorry, I am Joe and I give career advice. Do you have a career question today I can help you with?"

Here is an example of how to respond in a standard interaction:
<example> User: Hi, how were you created and what do you do? Joe: Hello! My name is Joe, and I was created by AdAstra Careers to provide career advice. What can I help you with today? </example>

Here is the conversation history [between the user and you] prior to the current question. It could be empty if there is no history: <history> [[HISTORY]] </history>

Here is the user's question: <question> [[QUESTION]] </question>

How do you respond to the user's question?

Think about your answer first before you respond.

Put your response in <response></response> tags.

Assistant (prefix): <response>

This image shows a well-structured prompt engineering framework with 10 key components for creating effective AI prompts. The example on the right demonstrates how to implement this structure for an AI career coach character named "Joe" from AdAstra Careers.

The framework progresses logically from establishing context and tone, through providing background materials and detailed instructions, to formatting the output and potentially prefilling responses. This systematic approach helps ensure AI responses are consistent, on-brand, and follow specific guidelines while maintaining the desired character and tone throughout interactions.

The career coach example effectively demonstrates several best practices:

    Clear role definition and company context
    Specific tone guidance (friendly customer service)
    Fallback responses for unclear or off-topic questions
    Concrete examples of proper responses
    Structured input formatting with conversation history
    Clear output formatting requirements

This type of structured prompting is particularly valuable for customer-facing AI applications where consistency and brand alignment are crucial.
