Refactor and extract the core logic from #file:main.rs, #file:main_tui.rs, and #file:tea_chat.rs into small, modular pieces of work. The main core✅ **COMPLETED**: ast-grep Integration - The Unstoppable Coding Monster

AST-grep has been successfully integrated into vtagent, transforming it into an "unstoppable coding monster" with syntax-aware code operations:

**New Tools Added:**
- `ast_grep_search`: Advanced AST-based pattern matching (e.g., find all console.log statements)
- `ast_grep_transform`: Safe code transformations using structural patterns
- `ast_grep_lint`: Rule-based code analysis for quality checks
- `ast_grep_refactor`: Intelligent refactoring suggestions

**Key Features:**
- Syntax-aware code operations that understand code structure
- Multi-language support (Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, C/C++, etc.)
- Safe transformations that preserve code semantics
- Pattern-based search using AST syntax like `"console.log($msg)"`, `"function $name($params) { $$ }"`
- Intelligent refactoring suggestions for code improvements

**Implementation:**
- CLI-based integration to avoid dependency conflicts
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Full integration with existing tool system
- Updated system prompts with AST-grep capabilities
- Created comprehensive usage guide (AST_GREP_GUIDE.md)

**Why it's an "Unstoppable Coding Monster":**
- Precision: AST-based matching eliminates false positives
- Safety: Transformations preserve code structure
- Scale: Process entire codebases with confidence
- Intelligence: Understand code semantics, not just text
- Flexibility: Create custom rules and patterns
- Speed: Fast pattern matching on large codebases

The integration successfully avoids tree-sitter version conflicts by using the ast-grep CLI interface, making it a robust and maintainable solution.

✅ **COMPLETED**: Code Refactoring and Modularization

The codebase has been successfully refactored to improve modularity and reduce code duplication:

**Refactored Components:**
- Extracted common utility functions into `vtagent-core/src/utils.rs`
- Removed duplicated functions between `main.rs` and `tools.rs`
- Improved separation of concerns across modules
- Added proper metadata to file reading operations
- Implemented batch file operations and dependency extraction tools

**Key Improvements:**
- Better code organization with clear module boundaries
- Eliminated code duplication for functions like `safe_replace_text`, `render_pty_output_fn`, and project overview functions
- Enhanced test coverage with passing tests
- Improved maintainability through modular design
- Added missing tool declarations for batch operations and dependency extraction

**Benefits:**
- Easier maintenance and future development
- Reduced risk of inconsistencies
- Better code reuse across modules
- Improved testability of individual componentscome too large. Run jscpd to detect duplicated code and fix any identified duplications. Ensure the refactored modules are well-organized, maintainable, and follow best practices for code separation.
