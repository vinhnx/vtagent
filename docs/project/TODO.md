Implement llm vtagent response token streaming for real-time response generation. Stream output in plain text during the agent's response. for tools call doesn't need streaming. make sure the streaming works with chat command. write tests for streaming functionality. update docs if necessary. update system prompt if needed. make sure streaming works with all models.

integrates the Hotpath profiler (available at https://deepwiki.com/pawurb/hotpath), a lightweight tool for pinpointing exactly where your code spends its time. Follow these steps:

1. Set up a basic Rust application (e.g., a simple CLI tool or web server using Tokio for async runtime) that includes some intentionally blocking operations, such as synchronous file I/O, network requests, or CPU-intensive loops, to demonstrate performance bottlenecks.

2. Add Hotpath as a dependency in Cargo.toml and instrument the code using Hotpath's APIs: Wrap key functions or sections with profiling scopes (e.g., `hotpath::scope("function_name")`) to capture timing data for hot paths.

3. Run the profiled application and generate a report to identify blocking code—focus on sections showing high wall-clock time due to synchronous blocking (e.g., `std::fs::read_to_string` or `reqwest::blocking::get`).

4. Refactor the blocking code to make it non-blocking: Convert synchronous operations to asynchronous equivalents (e.g., use `tokio::fs::read_to_string` or `reqwest` async client), offload CPU-bound tasks to worker threads via `tokio::spawn_blocking`, and ensure the main event loop remains responsive.

5. Include a main function that runs both the original blocking version and the refactored async version, compares their performance via Hotpath reports, and outputs the results to verify improvements (e.g., reduced blocking time and better throughput).

Provide the complete, compilable code with comments explaining the integration, instrumentation, and fixes. Use Rust 1.75+ and handle errors gracefully with `anyhow` or `thiserror`.

also run cargo check to check for dead code and fix any warnings or errors. make sure the codebase is clean and follows best practices. make sure cleanup dead code, and unused files and redundant code and dependencies. ensure code quality and maintainability. write tests. update docs.

check stream.rs in "WIP on main: 851c0c5 Consolidate todo management configuration from vtagent.toml and vtagent.toml.example; remove todo-related options to streamline project setup. Update documentation to reflect changes in task management tools and their usage." copy and apply

Interactive chat (tools)
Model: gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17
Workspace: /Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/vtagent
Detected languages: JavaScript:1, Python:1, Rust:160

Welcome! I preloaded workspace context so we can hit the ground running.

Project context:

-   Project: vtagent v0.4.2
-   Root: /Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/vtagent

Languages detected:

-   JavaScript:1, Python:1, Rust:160

Guideline highlights:

-   **Workspace Structure**: `vtagent-core/` (library) + `src/` (binary) with modular tools system
-   **Core Modules**: `llm/` (provider abstraction), `tools/` (modular tool system), `config/` (TOML-based settings)
-   **Integration Points**: Gemini API, tree-sitter parsers, PTY command execution, MCP tools
-   **Primary Config**: `vtagent.toml` (never hardcode settings)

How to work together:

-   Share the outcome you need or ask for a quick /status summary.
-   Reference AGENTS.md expectations before changing files.
-   Prefer focused tool calls (read_file, grep_search) before editing.

Recommended next actions:

-   Request a workspace orientation or describe the task you want to tackle.
-   Confirm priorities or blockers so I can suggest next steps.

Type 'exit' to quit, 'help' for commands
Suggested input: Describe your next coding goal (e.g., "analyze router config")

--> revise welcome message to make it more concise and user-friendly.
