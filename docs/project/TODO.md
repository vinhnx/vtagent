What can we learn from Anthropic’s Blog about building tools for Agents? Here are the key principles I extracted for building Tools and MCP Servers for Agents:

- Consolidate workflows: Implement `schedule_event` instead of separate `list_users`, `get_availability`, and `create_event` tools.

- Evaluate with real tasks: Test with goals like "find the project lead and schedule a meeting," not just "get user."

- Automate metrics: Programmatically run evaluations to track success rates, token counts, and tool call frequency.

- Let AI refactor: Feed failed evaluation transcripts to an LLM to get suggestions for improving your tool's code.

- Namespace tools clearly: Use prefixes to differentiate tools, such as `jira_search_issues` vs. `github_search_issues`.

- Return meaningful context: Prefer human-readable names like "Jane Doe" instead of cryptic `usr_7a3b4c9` IDs.

- Enforce token efficiency: Implement pagination and filtering for tools that can return long lists of results.

- Make errors helpful: Instead of `Invalid input`, return `Error: Missing 'user_id'. Example: search(user_id=12345)`.

- Guide with messages: If output is cut, guide with "Showing 10 of 100 results. Use the 'page' parameter for more."

- Use unambiguous parameter names: Use `user_email` or `user_id` instead of a generic `user` parameter.

- Define formats explicitly: In parameter descriptions, specify requirements like "Date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format."

- Provide examples in descriptions: Add an `Example: search_query='status:open'` to the parameter's help text.

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) can empower LLM agents with potentially hundreds of tools to solve real-world tasks. But how do we make those tools maximally effective?

In this post, we describe our most effective techniques for improving performance in a variety of agentic AI systems <sup>1</sup>.

We begin by covering how you can:

- Build and test prototypes of your tools
- Create and run comprehensive evaluations of your tools with agents
- Collaborate with agents like Claude Code to automatically increase the performance of your tools

We conclude with key principles for writing high-quality tools we’ve identified along the way:

- Choosing the right tools to implement (and not to implement)
- Namespacing tools to define clear boundaries in functionality
- Returning meaningful context from tools back to agents
- Optimizing tool responses for token efficiency
- Prompt-engineering tool descriptions and specs

![This is an image depicting how an engineer might use Claude Code to evaluate the efficacy of agentic tools.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fcdc027ad2730e4732168bb198fc9363678544f99-1920x1080.png&w=3840&q=75)

Building an evaluation allows you to systematically measure the performance of your tools. You can use Claude Code to automatically optimize your tools against this evaluation.

## What is a tool?

In computing, deterministic systems produce the same output every time given identical inputs, while *non-deterministic* systems—like agents—can generate varied responses even with the same starting conditions.

When we traditionally write software, we’re establishing a contract between deterministic systems. For instance, a function call like `getWeather(“NYC”)` will always fetch the weather in New York City in the exact same manner every time it is called.

Tools are a new kind of software which reflects a contract between deterministic systems and non-deterministic agents. When a user asks "Should I bring an umbrella today?,” an agent might call the weather tool, answer from general knowledge, or even ask a clarifying question about location first. Occasionally, an agent might hallucinate or even fail to grasp how to use a tool.

This means fundamentally rethinking our approach when writing software for agents: instead of writing tools and [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) the way we’d write functions and APIs for other developers or systems, we need to design them for agents.

Our goal is to increase the surface area over which agents can be effective in solving a wide range of tasks by using tools to pursue a variety of successful strategies. Fortunately, in our experience, the tools that are most “ergonomic” for agents also end up being surprisingly intuitive to grasp as humans.

## How to write tools

In this section, we describe how you can collaborate with agents both to write and to improve the tools you give them. Start by standing up a quick prototype of your tools and testing them locally. Next, run a comprehensive evaluation to measure subsequent changes. Working alongside agents, you can repeat the process of evaluating and improving your tools until your agents achieve strong performance on real-world tasks.

### Building a prototype

It can be difficult to anticipate which tools agents will find ergonomic and which tools they won’t without getting hands-on yourself. Start by standing up a quick prototype of your tools. If you’re using [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) to write your tools (potentially in one-shot), it helps to give Claude documentation for any software libraries, APIs, or SDKs (including potentially the [MCP SDK](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/sdk)) your tools will rely on. LLM-friendly documentation can commonly be found in flat `llms.txt` files on official documentation sites (here’s our [API’s](https://docs.anthropic.com/llms.txt)).

Wrapping your tools in a [local MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-local-servers) or [Desktop extension](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions) (DXT) will allow you to connect and test your tools in Claude Code or the Claude Desktop app.

To connect your local MCP server to Claude Code, run `claude mcp add <name> <command> [args...]`.

To connect your local MCP server or DXT to the Claude Desktop app, navigate to `Settings > Developer` or `Settings > Extensions`, respectively.

Tools can also be passed directly into [Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) calls for programmatic testing.

Test the tools yourself to identify any rough edges. Collect feedback from your users to build an intuition around the use-cases and prompts you expect your tools to enable.

### Running an evaluation

Next, you need to measure how well Claude uses your tools by running an evaluation. Start by generating lots of evaluation tasks, grounded in real world uses. We recommend collaborating with an agent to help analyze your results and determine how to improve your tools. See this process end-to-end in our [tool evaluation cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/tool_evaluation/tool_evaluation.ipynb).

**Generating evaluation tasks**

With your early prototype, Claude Code can quickly explore your tools and create dozens of prompt and response pairs. Prompts should be inspired by real-world uses and be based on realistic data sources and services (for example, internal knowledge bases and microservices). We recommend you avoid overly simplistic or superficial “sandbox” environments that don’t stress-test your tools with sufficient complexity. Strong evaluation tasks might require multiple tool calls—potentially dozens.

Here are some examples of strong tasks:

- Schedule a meeting with Jane next week to discuss our latest Acme Corp project. Attach the notes from our last project planning meeting and reserve a conference room.
- Customer ID 9182 reported that they were charged three times for a single purchase attempt. Find all relevant log entries and determine if any other customers were affected by the same issue.
- Customer Sarah Chen just submitted a cancellation request. Prepare a retention offer. Determine: (1) why they're leaving, (2) what retention offer would be most compelling, and (3) any risk factors we should be aware of before making an offer.

And here are some weaker tasks:

- Schedule a meeting with jane@acme.corp next week.
- Search the payment logs for `purchase_complete` and `customer_id=9182`.
- Find the cancellation request by Customer ID 45892.

Each evaluation prompt should be paired with a verifiable response or outcome. Your verifier can be as simple as an exact string comparison between ground truth and sampled responses, or as advanced as enlisting Claude to judge the response. Avoid overly strict verifiers that reject correct responses due to spurious differences like formatting, punctuation, or valid alternative phrasings.

For each prompt-response pair, you can optionally also specify the tools you expect an agent to call in solving the task, to measure whether or not agents are successful in grasping each tool’s purpose during evaluation. However, because there might be multiple valid paths to solving tasks correctly, try to avoid overspecifying or overfitting to strategies.

**Running the evaluation**

We recommend running your evaluation programmatically with direct LLM API calls. Use simple agentic loops (`while` -loops wrapping alternating LLM API and tool calls): one loop for each evaluation task. Each evaluation agent should be given a single task prompt and your tools.

In your evaluation agents’ system prompts, we recommend instructing agents to output not just structured response blocks (for verification), but also reasoning and feedback blocks. Instructing agents to output these *before* tool call and response blocks may increase LLMs’ effective intelligence by triggering chain-of-thought (CoT) behaviors.

If you’re running your evaluation with Claude, you can turn on [interleaved thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#interleaved-thinking) for similar functionality “off-the-shelf”. This will help you probe why agents do or don’t call certain tools and highlight specific areas of improvement in tool descriptions and specs.

As well as top-level accuracy, we recommend collecting other metrics like the total runtime of individual tool calls and tasks, the total number of tool calls, the total token consumption, and tool errors. Tracking tool calls can help reveal common workflows that agents pursue and offer some opportunities for tools to consolidate.

![This graph measures the test set accuracy of human-written vs. Claude-optimized Asana MCP servers.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F3f1f47e80974750cd924bc51e42b6df1ad997fab-1920x1080.png&w=3840&q=75)

**Analyzing results**
Agents are your helpful partners in spotting issues and providing feedback on everything from contradictory tool descriptions to inefficient tool implementations and confusing tool schemas. However, keep in mind that what agents omit in their feedback and responses can often be more important than what they include. LLMs don’t always [say what they mean](https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model).

Observe where your agents get stumped or confused. Read through your evaluation agents’ reasoning and feedback (or CoT) to identify rough edges. Review the raw transcripts (including tool calls and tool responses) to catch any behavior not explicitly described in the agent’s CoT. Read between the lines; remember that your evaluation agents don’t necessarily know the correct answers and strategies.

Analyze your tool calling metrics. Lots of redundant tool calls might suggest some rightsizing of pagination or token limit parameters is warranted; lots of tool errors for invalid parameters might suggest tools could use clearer descriptions or better examples. When we launched Claude’s [web search tool](https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search), we identified that Claude was needlessly appending `2025` to the tool’s `query` parameter, biasing search results and degrading performance (we steered Claude in the right direction by improving the tool description).

### Collaborating with agents

You can even let agents analyze your results and improve your tools for you. Simply concatenate the transcripts from your evaluation agents and paste them into Claude Code. Claude is an expert at analyzing transcripts and refactoring lots of tools all at once—for example, to ensure tool implementations and descriptions remain self-consistent when new changes are made.

In fact, most of the advice in this post came from repeatedly optimizing our internal tool implementations with Claude Code. Our evaluations were created on top of our internal workspace, mirroring the complexity of our internal workflows, including real projects, documents, and messages.

We relied on held-out test sets to ensure we did not overfit to our “training” evaluations. These test sets revealed that we could extract additional performance improvements even beyond what we achieved with "expert" tool implementations—whether those tools were manually written by our researchers or generated by Claude itself.

In the next section, we’ll share some of what we learned from this process.

## Principles for writing effective tools

In this section, we distill our learnings into a few guiding principles for writing effective tools.

### Choosing the right tools for agents

More tools don’t always lead to better outcomes. A common error we’ve observed is tools that merely wrap existing software functionality or API endpoints—whether or not the tools are appropriate for agents. This is because agents have distinct “affordances” to traditional software—that is, they have different ways of perceiving the potential actions they can take with those tools

LLM agents have limited "context" (that is, there are limits to how much information they can process at once), whereas computer memory is cheap and abundant. Consider the task of searching for a contact in an address book. Traditional software programs can efficiently store and process a list of contacts one at a time, checking each one before moving on.

However, if an LLM agent uses a tool that returns ALL contacts and then has to read through each one token-by-token, it's wasting its limited context space on irrelevant information (imagine searching for a contact in your address book by reading each page from top-to-bottom—that is, via brute-force search). The better and more natural approach (for agents and humans alike) is to skip to the relevant page first (perhaps finding it alphabetically).

We recommend building a few thoughtful tools targeting specific high-impact workflows, which match your evaluation tasks and scaling up from there. In the address book case, you might choose to implement a `search_contacts` or `message_contact` tool instead of a `list_contacts` tool.

Tools can consolidate functionality, handling potentially *multiple* discrete operations (or API calls) under the hood. For example, tools can enrich tool responses with related metadata or handle frequently chained, multi-step tasks in a single tool call.

Here are some examples:

- Instead of implementing a `list_users`, `list_events`, and `create_event` tools, consider implementing a `schedule_event` tool which finds availability and schedules an event.
- Instead of implementing a `read_logs` tool, consider implementing a `search_logs` tool which only returns relevant log lines and some surrounding context.
- Instead of implementing `get_customer_by_id`, `list_transactions`, and `list_notes` tools, implement a `get_customer_context` tool which compiles all of a customer’s recent & relevant information all at once.

Make sure each tool you build has a clear, distinct purpose. Tools should enable agents to subdivide and solve tasks in much the same way that a human would, given access to the same underlying resources, and simultaneously reduce the context that would have otherwise been consumed by intermediate outputs.

Too many tools or overlapping tools can also distract agents from pursuing efficient strategies. Careful, selective planning of the tools you build (or don’t build) can really pay off.

### Namespacing your tools

Your AI agents will potentially gain access to dozens of MCP servers and hundreds of different tools–including those by other developers. When tools overlap in function or have a vague purpose, agents can get confused about which ones to use.

Namespacing (grouping related tools under common prefixes) can help delineate boundaries between lots of tools; MCP clients sometimes do this by default. For example, namespacing tools by service (e.g., `asana_search`, `jira_search`) and by resource (e.g., `asana_projects_search`, `asana_users_search`), can help agents select the right tools at the right time.

We have found selecting between prefix- and suffix-based namespacing to have non-trivial effects on our tool-use evaluations. Effects vary by LLM and we encourage you to choose a naming scheme according to your own evaluations.

Agents might call the wrong tools, call the right tools with the wrong parameters, call too few tools, or process tool responses incorrectly. By selectively implementing tools whose names reflect natural subdivisions of tasks, you simultaneously reduce the number of tools and tool descriptions loaded into the agent’s context and offload agentic computation from the agent’s context back into the tool calls themselves. This reduces an agent’s overall risk of making mistakes.

### Returning meaningful context from your tools

In the same vein, tool implementations should take care to return only high signal information back to agents. They should prioritize contextual relevance over flexibility, and eschew low-level technical identifiers (for example: `uuid`, `256px_image_url`, `mime_type`). Fields like `name`, `image_url`, and `file_type` are much more likely to directly inform agents’ downstream actions and responses.

Agents also tend to grapple with natural language names, terms, or identifiers significantly more successfully than they do with cryptic identifiers. We’ve found that merely resolving arbitrary alphanumeric UUIDs to more semantically meaningful and interpretable language (or even a 0-indexed ID scheme) significantly improves Claude’s precision in retrieval tasks by reducing hallucinations.

In some instances, agents may require the flexibility to interact with both natural language and technical identifiers outputs, if only to trigger downstream tool calls (for example, `search_user(name=’jane’)` → `send_message(id=12345)`). You can enable both by exposing a simple `response_format` enum parameter in your tool, allowing your agent to control whether tools return `“concise”` or `“detailed”` responses (images below).

You can add more formats for even greater flexibility, similar to GraphQL where you can choose exactly which pieces of information you want to receive. Here is an example ResponseFormat enum to control tool response verbosity:

```
enum ResponseFormat {
   DETAILED = "detailed",
   CONCISE = "concise"
}
```

Here’s an example of a detailed tool response (206 tokens):

![This code snippet depicts an example of a detailed tool response.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F5ed0d30526bf68624f335d075b8c1541be3bb595-1920x1006.png&w=3840&q=75)

This code snippet depicts an example of a detailed tool response.

Here’s an example of a concise tool response (72 tokens):

Even your tool response structure—for example XML, JSON, or Markdown—can have an impact on evaluation performance: there is no one-size-fits-all solution. This is because LLMs are trained on next-token prediction and tend to perform better with formats that match their training data. The optimal response structure will vary widely by task and agent. We encourage you to select the best response structure based on your own evaluation.

### Optimizing tool responses for token efficiency

Optimizing the quality of context is important. But so is optimizing the *quantity* of context returned back to agents in tool responses.

We suggest implementing some combination of pagination, range selection, filtering, and/or truncation with sensible default parameter values for any tool responses that could use up lots of context. For Claude Code, we restrict tool responses to 25,000 tokens by default. We expect the effective context length of agents to grow over time, but the need for context-efficient tools to remain.

If you choose to truncate responses, be sure to steer agents with helpful instructions. You can directly encourage agents to pursue more token-efficient strategies, like making many small and targeted searches instead of a single, broad search for a knowledge retrieval task. Similarly, if a tool call raises an error (for example, during input validation), you can prompt-engineer your error responses to clearly communicate specific and actionable improvements, rather than opaque error codes or tracebacks.

Here’s an example of a truncated tool response:

![This image depicts an example of a truncated tool response.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fe440d6a69d0ca80e71f3bec5c2d00906ff03ce6d-1920x1162.png&w=3840&q=75)

This image depicts an example of a truncated tool response.

Here’s an example of an unhelpful error response:

![This image depicts an example of an unhelpful tool response. ](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F2445187904704fec8c50af0b950e310ba743fac2-1920x733.png&w=3840&q=75)

This image depicts an example of an unhelpful tool response.

Here’s an example of a helpful error response:

### Prompt-engineering your tool descriptions

We now come to one of the most effective methods for improving tools: prompt-engineering your tool descriptions and specs. Because these are loaded into your agents’ context, they can collectively steer agents toward effective tool-calling behaviors.

When writing tool descriptions and specs, think of how you would describe your tool to a new hire on your team. Consider the context that you might implicitly bring—specialized query formats, definitions of niche terminology, relationships between underlying resources—and make it explicit. Avoid ambiguity by clearly describing (and enforcing with strict data models) expected inputs and outputs. In particular, input parameters should be unambiguously named: instead of a parameter named `user`, try a parameter named `user_id`.

With your evaluation you can measure the impact of your prompt engineering with greater confidence. Even small refinements to tool descriptions can yield dramatic improvements. Claude Sonnet 3.5 achieved state-of-the-art performance on the [SWE-bench Verified](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/swe-bench-sonnet) evaluation after we made precise refinements to tool descriptions, dramatically reducing error rates and improving task completion.

You can find other best practices for tool definitions in our [Developer Guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/implement-tool-use#best-practices-for-tool-definitions). If you’re building tools for Claude, we also recommend reading about how tools are dynamically loaded into Claude’s [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/implement-tool-use#tool-use-system-prompt). Lastly, if you’re writing tools for an MCP server, [tool annotations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools) help disclose which tools require open-world access or make destructive changes.

## Looking ahead

To build effective tools for agents, we need to re-orient our software development practices from predictable, deterministic patterns to non-deterministic ones.

Through the iterative, evaluation-driven process we’ve described in this post, we've identified consistent patterns in what makes tools successful: Effective tools are intentionally and clearly defined, use agent context judiciously, can be combined together in diverse workflows, and enable agents to intuitively solve real-world tasks.

In the future, we expect the specific mechanisms through which agents interact with the world to evolve—from updates to the MCP protocol to upgrades to the underlying LLMs themselves. With a systematic, evaluation-driven approach to improving tools for agents, we can ensure that as agents become more capable, the tools they use will evolve alongside them.

--
Review and refactor the source code in the `src/cli/` directory to unify the handling of command-line arguments (CLI args) and configuration loading across all relevant files and modules. Ensure consistent parsing of args using a standardized library (e.g., argparse or commander.js), merge overlapping config loading logic into a single, reusable function or class, eliminate redundancies, and add comprehensive error handling, documentation, and tests for the unified approach.

Additionally, implement a '/' slash activation command in the chat agent mode. This command should trigger agent activation when entered in the chat interface, responding with a confirmation message (e.g., "Agent activated!") and enabling full agent functionality, while ignoring non-slash inputs until activation. Include safeguards to prevent accidental activation and integrate it seamlessly with the existing chat loop.

Scan the codebase for placeholder comments like "// real implementation" or similar stubs indicating unfinished logic. For each instance, analyze the surrounding context, infer the intended functionality, and replace the comment with a complete, working implementation using appropriate language features, best practices, and error handling. Ensure the code is efficient, readable, and integrates seamlessly without breaking existing functionality. If assumptions are needed, document them inline.

--

Refactor the Rust file located at `vtagent-core/src/core/agent/integration.rs` to improve its modularity, readability, and maintainability. Begin by analyzing the current structure: identify key functions, dependencies, and potential issues such as tight coupling, long methods, or duplicated logic. Then, create a step-by-step refactoring plan that includes:

1. **Breakdown Phase**: Decompose the file into smaller, focused components (e.g., separate modules for integration logic, error handling, configuration, and testing utilities). Suggest new module boundaries and extract methods or structs where appropriate.

2. **Composition Phase**: Recompose these components into a cohesive structure, ensuring clear interfaces, minimal dependencies, and adherence to Rust best practices (e.g., using traits for abstraction, enums for state management).

3. **Validation Steps**: Outline how to test the refactored code, including unit tests for new components and integration tests to verify overall functionality remains unchanged.

Provide the plan in a structured format with rationale for each change, followed by the refactored code snippets or full file if feasible. Ensure the refactoring preserves the original behavior while enhancing extensibility.

If you follow me you know that I love Claude Code and I probably changed my life

Been wondering why is leagues ahead of all coding agents before it... so I spent some time digging under the hood.

TAKEAWAY: "Simple is better than complex.
(my favorite line from the Zen of Python)

@AnthropicAI
 build a dead simple, 2-layer agentic system. Everyone else built multi-agent swarms, huge DAGs, or other overengineered messes.

A single-threaded master loop enhanced with a message steering queue, a few key tools, and TODO-based planning

▶️ nO (Master Agent)
A beautifully minimal loop. while(tool_call) → execute → feed results → repeat. One flat message history. No swarms. No competing personas. Pure, debuggable simplicity that terminates naturally when Claude produces a text-only response.

▶️ h2A (Async Buffer)
Pause/resume support lets you inject new instructions mid-task without restarting. It transforms batch processing into something like pair programming.

▶️ Tools
Regex over embeddings. Markdown over databases. Direct file operations over complex abstractions. Acts like a human using bash.

▶️ TODOs & Reminders
Claude writes structured task lists that render as interactive checklists. After each tool use, system reminders inject the current TODO state, keeping the agent laser-focused even in marathon sessions.

Claude Code proves that a simple while loop, executed with discipline and the right tools, can outperform most orchestration framework. Max depth of 2.

A Best Practices Guide to Developing and Deploying Reliable Agentic AI Systems

Agentic AI systems represent a significant evolution from traditional language models. While a language model responds to a given prompt, an agentic system can act autonomously—planning, using tools, and orchestrating complex workflows to achieve high-level objectives. To build these systems effectively is akin to creating a complex work of art on a technical canvas; it requires not just a powerful cognitive engine like a large language model, but also a robust set of architectural blueprints. These blueprints, or agentic design patterns, provide the structure needed to transform reactive models into proactive, goal-oriented entities.

This guide provides AI developers and system architects with a comprehensive framework of best practices for building systems that are robust, efficient, reliable, and trustworthy. It details the essential patterns that govern how agents are instructed, how they execute tasks, how they perceive and reason about their environment, and how they are engineered for production-grade reliability. We begin with the foundational layer that underpins every action an agent takes: the prompting interface.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Core Principle: Mastering the Prompting Interface

Prompting is not merely the act of asking a model a question; it is a disciplined engineering practice. The prompt is the primary interface to the Large Language Model (LLM) at an agent's core, and mastering this interface is the non-negotiable foundation for controlling its behavior and eliciting reliable, high-quality responses. Every instruction, every piece of context, and every structural element within a prompt directly influences the agent's performance. While prompting controls the LLM, architecting the agent's workflow is the next critical layer of design.

1.1. The Engineering Discipline of Prompting

Prompt engineering is the process of methodically crafting and refining inputs to consistently guide a model towards a desired output. Well-designed prompts can maximize the potential of language models, resulting in accurate, relevant, and creative responses. In contrast, poorly designed prompts are ambiguous and can lead to irrelevant, erroneous, or unpredictable outputs, hindering the development of reliable systems.

1.2. Fundamental Prompting Principles

Effective prompting rests on a set of core principles that are applicable across all models and tasks.

* Clarity and Specificity: Instructions must be unambiguous and precise. Vague language can lead to multiple interpretations and unintended responses. A well-designed prompt clearly defines the task, the desired output format, and any relevant constraints.
* Conciseness: While specificity is crucial, instructions should be direct and to the point. Unnecessary wording or overly complex sentence structures can confuse the model and obscure the primary objective.
* Action-Oriented Language: The choice of verbs is a key tool for guiding the model. Direct, active verbs clearly delineate the desired operation and help the model activate the relevant processes for that task. Effective verbs include: Act, Analyze, Categorize, Classify, Compare, Contrast, Create, Describe, Define, Evaluate, Extract, Find, Generate, Identify, List, Measure, Organize, Parse, Predict, Provide, Rank, Recommend, Retrieve, Rewrite, Sort, Summarize, and Translate.
* Positive Instructions Over Constraints: It is generally more effective to specify the desired action rather than outlining what not to do. While negative constraints have a role in safety or strict formatting, framing prompts positively reduces confusion and aligns with how humans naturally provide guidance.
* Experimentation and Iteration: Prompt engineering is an iterative process. The most effective prompt is often discovered through cycles of drafting, testing, analyzing the output, and refining the instructions. It is vital to document these attempts to track what works and why.

1.3. Foundational Prompting Techniques

Building on core principles, these foundational techniques provide the model with varying levels of information to direct its responses.

* Zero-Shot Prompting
* Zero-shot prompting provides the model with an instruction and input data without any examples of the desired input-output pair. It relies entirely on the model's pre-training to understand and execute the task.
* When to use: This is the quickest approach and is often sufficient for simple tasks the model has likely encountered during training, such as basic summarization, text completion, or simple question answering.
* One-Shot Prompting
* This technique involves providing the model with a single example of an input and its corresponding desired output before presenting the actual task. This demonstration serves as a template for the model to replicate.
* When to use: One-shot prompting is useful when the desired output format or style is specific or less common. It gives the model a concrete instance to learn from and can improve performance for tasks requiring a particular structure or tone.
* Few-Shot Prompting
* Few-shot prompting enhances the one-shot technique by supplying several examples (typically three to five) of input-output pairs. This provides a clearer pattern of expected responses, improving the likelihood that the model will replicate it for new inputs.
* When to use: This technique is highly effective for tasks where the output must adhere to a specific format, style, or nuanced variation. It is excellent for classification, structured data extraction, or generating text in a particular style.
* The effectiveness of few-shot prompting depends heavily on the quality and diversity of the examples. They must be accurate, representative, and cover potential variations. For classification tasks, it is a best practice to mix up the order of examples from different classes to prevent the model from overfitting to a specific sequence. As modern LLMs with long context windows have become more powerful, this technique has evolved into "many-shot" learning, where providing hundreds of examples within the prompt can unlock optimal performance for complex tasks.

1.4. Structuring Prompts for Granular Control

Just as code requires clear syntax and structure, a prompt must be architected to help the model parse each component's role, leading to more deterministic and reliable outputs.

* System Prompting A system prompt sets the foundational guidelines for an agent's behavior throughout an interaction. It can define a persona, establish rules, or enforce safety controls. Some services also use system prompts for automatic optimization to enhance performance.
* Role Prompting Assigning a specific persona or identity to the model enhances the quality and relevance of its output. This guides the model to adopt the knowledge, tone, and communication style associated with that role.
* Using Delimiters Delimiters, such as triple backticks (```) or XML tags (<instruction>), visually and programmatically separate different sections of a prompt (e.g., instructions, context, input). This minimizes the risk of misinterpretation by clarifying the role of each part of the text.
* Requesting Structured Output For creating reliable, automated pipelines, requesting a machine-readable format like JSON is critical. This forces the model to organize its response into a defined structure, which can be easily parsed by other system components and can also help limit hallucinations.
* Validating Structured Output with Pydantic Using a library like Pydantic provides an object-oriented facade to the LLM's structured output. By defining a Pydantic model, you create an enforceable schema that validates the LLM's JSON response, transforming it into a type-hinted Python object. This ensures data integrity and interoperability between different parts of your system.

1.5. Advanced Contextual Engineering

Context Engineering is the discipline of dynamically providing a comprehensive operational picture for an agent, going beyond static system prompts. This context includes multiple informational layers:

* System prompts: Foundational instructions defining the agent's core behavior.
* External data: Retrieved documents from a knowledge base or real-time data from tool outputs.
* Implicit data: User identity, interaction history, and environmental state.

This practice reframes development from simply optimizing query phrasing to engineering robust, real-time data pipelines that construct a comprehensive operational picture for the agent.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Architecting Intelligent Agentic Workflows

Individual prompts are the building blocks for larger, more complex agentic workflows. To handle multi-step problems efficiently and intelligently, these blocks must be assembled using proven architectural patterns. This section details the patterns for orchestrating tasks, from simple sequences to dynamic, logic-driven flows. These architectural patterns provide the skeleton for an agent, which must then be empowered with capabilities to interact, reason, and remember.

2.1. Sequential Task Decomposition (Prompt Chaining)

The Prompt Chaining (or Pipeline) pattern is a "divide-and-conquer" strategy for handling complex tasks. Instead of writing a single, intricate prompt, the task is broken down into a sequence of simpler, more focused sub-tasks.

Its core benefit is enhanced reliability and control. By decomposing the problem, the cognitive load on the LLM is reduced at each step, leading to more accurate and predictable results. For example, creating a market research report can be chained in three steps:

1. Summarization: A prompt takes the raw report and generates a concise summary.
2. Trend Identification: The summary is passed to a second prompt that identifies key trends and extracts supporting data points.
3. Email Composition: The extracted trends and data are passed to a final prompt that drafts a targeted email to the marketing team.

Architects must, however, weigh these benefits against the potential for increased latency, as each step in the chain introduces an additional LLM call. The reliability of this pipeline is therefore critically dependent on the principles of structured output detailed in Section 1.4, as passing validated JSON objects is essential to prevent error propagation.

2.2. Concurrent Task Execution (Parallelization)

The Parallelization pattern involves the simultaneous execution of multiple independent components. In contrast to the sequential nature of prompt chaining, this pattern is vital for improving efficiency and responsiveness.

For example, a research agent tasked with analyzing a company could execute several tasks in parallel: search for recent news articles, pull the latest stock data from an API, and query an internal database for company information. Since these tasks are independent, running them concurrently drastically reduces the total time required to gather a comprehensive view. However, architects must account for the increased complexity in state management and error handling, as well as the potential for API rate limiting when making simultaneous calls.

2.3. Conditional Logic and Dynamic Path Selection (Routing)

The Routing pattern enables an agent to make intelligent decisions and select a dynamic path based on the user's input. This is often implemented using a dedicated "Router Agent."

This router analyzes an incoming query to determine its complexity or intent. Based on this analysis, it directs the query to the most appropriate downstream agent or tool. For instance, a simple factual question might be routed to a fast, inexpensive model, while a complex request requiring multi-step reasoning would be sent to a more powerful, capable model. While this pattern optimizes resource use, it introduces the overhead of an additional LLM call for the routing step, which must be factored into the system's overall latency and cost.

2.4. Strategic Goal Decomposition (Planning)

The Planning pattern empowers an agent to take a high-level objective and autonomously generate a series of intermediate steps or sub-goals to achieve it. This is analogous to how a person might plan a trip: they don't just appear at the destination but first break the goal down into steps like booking flights, reserving a hotel, and packing.

This pattern is foundational for transforming a simple reactive system into one that can proactively work towards a defined objective. This autonomy comes at the cost of increased computational overhead, as the planning phase itself requires significant reasoning. Furthermore, the quality of the generated plan is not guaranteed and may require self-correction mechanisms to adapt to unforeseen obstacles.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Empowering Agents with Advanced Capabilities

A workflow architecture must be imbued with capabilities that allow the agent to perceive, reason about, and act upon its environment. An agent with a well-designed structure is inert without the ability to use tools, access knowledge, or perform complex cognitive tasks. This section explores the patterns for tool use, knowledge acquisition, and advanced reasoning. Once an agent is made capable, it must also be engineered to be reliable, safe, and efficient.

3.1. Interacting with the External World: Tool Use and Protocols

3.1.1. The Tool Use Pattern (Function Calling)

Tool use is what transforms a language model from a text generator into an agent that can act. The process follows a five-step cycle:

1. Tool Definition: An external function (e.g., a web search API, a database query) is described to the LLM, including its purpose and parameters.
2. LLM Decision: Based on the user's request, the LLM decides if a tool is needed to fulfill the request.
3. Function Call Generation: The LLM generates a structured output (e.g., JSON) specifying the tool to call and the arguments to use.
4. Tool Execution: The agentic framework intercepts this output, executes the actual function, and retrieves the result.
5. Observation/Result: The tool's output is returned to the LLM as context, which it uses to formulate a final response or decide the next step.

3.1.2. Standardizing External Interfaces (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a universal, open standard for connecting LLMs to external tools and data sources. Functioning like a "universal adapter," it uses a client-server architecture to define how tools and resources are exposed by an MCP server and consumed by an LLM-powered client. This promotes interoperability and reusability, allowing any compliant tool to be accessed by any compliant LLM, which is a significant advantage over proprietary, vendor-specific function calling.

3.1.3. Enabling Agent-to-Agent Collaboration (A2A)

The Inter-Agent Communication (A2A) protocol is an open standard designed to enable communication between AI agents, even if they are built on different frameworks. It provides a structured approach for agent interactions, with a core component being the "Agent Card," a digital identity file (usually JSON) that describes an agent's capabilities, skills, and communication endpoints. This allows agents to discover and collaborate with one another to solve complex problems.

3.2. Building a Knowledge Base: Memory and Retrieval

3.2.1. The Dual-Component Memory System

Stateful agents require a memory system with two distinct components:

* Short-Term Memory: This is the ephemeral context window of the LLM, which holds recent messages and tool outputs from the current interaction. While models with long context windows have expanded this capacity, the information is still lost once the session ends.
* Long-Term Memory: This is a persistent knowledge store, typically an external database, knowledge graph, or vector database. It allows an agent to retain information across sessions, recall user preferences, and learn from past interactions.

3.2.2. Grounding in Facts (Retrieval-Augmented Generation - RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the mechanism that allows an agent to access and integrate external information before generating a response. Its key benefits include accessing up-to-date information, reducing hallucinations by grounding responses in verifiable data, and providing citations. The process relies on three core concepts:

1. Chunking: Large documents in the knowledge base are broken down into smaller, manageable pieces.
2. Embeddings: These chunks are converted into numerical vector representations that capture their semantic meaning.
3. Vector Databases: The embeddings are stored in a specialized database optimized for rapid semantic search, allowing the system to find the most relevant chunks for a given query.

3.2.3. Evolving RAG with an Agentic Layer

Agentic RAG is a sophisticated evolution of the RAG pattern. It introduces a reasoning and decision-making layer where an agent acts as a "critical gatekeeper." Instead of passively accepting retrieved data, this agent actively interrogates its quality, relevance, and completeness. For example, it can perform source validation by prioritizing an official 2025 policy document over an outdated 2020 blog post, reconcile knowledge conflicts between contradictory sources, and use external tools like a web search to fill knowledge gaps in its internal database. Furthermore, the agent can decompose complex queries into multiple sub-queries, gather the disparate information, and synthesize it into a structured context, enabling a comprehensive response that a simple retrieval could not produce.

3.3. Enhancing Cognitive Abilities: Advanced Reasoning Techniques

3.3.1. Eliciting Step-by-Step Logic (Chain of Thought)

Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique that improves reasoning by instructing the model to generate intermediate steps before arriving at a final answer. By breaking a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts (e.g., by adding "Let's think step by step" to the prompt), CoT makes the model's logic more transparent, robust, and accurate, particularly for tasks requiring calculation or logical deduction.

3.3.2. Integrating Reasoning with Action (ReAct)

The ReAct paradigm elevates agentic capability by fusing the internal monologue of Chain of Thought (3.3.1) with the external interactions of Tool Use (3.1.1) into a synergistic, interleaved process. It operates in a loop of Thought, Action, and Observation. The agent first generates a thought about its plan, then performs an action using a tool, and finally observes the result. This feedback loop allows the agent to dynamically gather information, react to its environment, and refine its plan based on real-time outcomes.

3.3.3. The Scaling Inference Law

This principle states that a model's performance on complex problems predictably improves with increased computational resources allocated at inference time. Providing an agent with a larger "thinking budget"—more time, more iterative steps, or more exploratory paths—often significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of its final solution. This critically challenges the notion that a larger model is always better, demonstrating that a smaller model with a more substantial 'thinking budget' at inference can significantly outperform a larger model that relies on a simpler generation process.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Engineering for Reliability, Safety, and Efficiency

While the architectural patterns in Section 2 and advanced capabilities in Section 3 define what an agent can do, the non-functional patterns in this section govern how it performs in a production environment. For an agent to be deployable, it must be engineered with the same rigor for reliability, safety, and efficiency as any traditional software system. Even a perfectly engineered agent, however, requires a framework for ongoing performance measurement and improvement.

4.1. Ensuring Purposeful Action: Goal Setting and Monitoring

The Goal Setting and Monitoring pattern provides a framework for giving agents specific, measurable objectives and the means to track their progress. This is fundamental for building agents that can operate autonomously and reliably to achieve a specific outcome without constant human intervention. For example, a "Customer Support Automation" agent's goal might be to "resolve a customer's billing inquiry." It would monitor the conversation, use tools to check and adjust billing, and define success as a confirmed change and positive customer feedback. If the goal remains unmet, it would trigger an escalation.

4.2. Building Resilient Systems: Exception Handling and Recovery

This pattern equips an agent with the ability to manage operational failures, such as tool errors or service unavailability, ensuring it can maintain functionality. It involves a three-stage process:

1. Error Detection: Identifying issues as they arise, such as invalid tool outputs, API errors (e.g., 404 Not Found), or unusually long response times.
2. Error Handling: Implementing strategies to manage the detected error, such as detailed logging, retrying the action (often with exponential backoff), or using fallback methods to maintain partial functionality.
3. Recovery: Restoring the system to a stable state through mechanisms like rolling back recent changes, engaging a self-correction process to adjust its plan, or escalating the issue to a human operator.

Implementing comprehensive exception handling adds significant complexity to the agent's logic and state management, a trade-off that is essential for production-grade resilience.

4.3. Implementing Safety and Ethical Boundaries: Guardrails

Guardrails (or Safety Patterns) are the crucial mechanisms that ensure an agent operates safely, ethically, and as intended. They serve as a multi-layered defense mechanism to guide behavior and prevent harmful or undesirable responses. Key types of guardrails include:

* Input Validation: Filtering malicious or inappropriate user prompts.
* Output Filtering: Analyzing generated responses for toxicity, bias, or sensitive information.
* Behavioral Constraints: Using prompts to enforce rules of engagement.
* Tool Use Restrictions: Limiting which external tools an agent can access or what actions it can perform.
* Human Oversight: Integrating human review for high-stakes decisions.

Architects must carefully design guardrails to be effective without overly constraining the agent's useful capabilities, a balance that often requires extensive testing and fine-tuning.

4.4. Strategic Human Oversight: The Human-in-the-Loop Pattern

The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) pattern deliberately integrates human judgment into an agent's workflow. It is essential in domains characterized by complexity, ambiguity, or significant risk where full autonomy is imprudent. HITL involves several key aspects:

* Human Oversight: Monitoring agent performance and output to ensure adherence to guidelines.
* Intervention and Correction: Allowing human operators to rectify errors or guide the agent when it encounters an ambiguous scenario.
* Escalation Policies: Establishing clear protocols for when and how an agent should hand off a task to a human.

A variation is 'human-on-the-loop,' which is better suited for high-speed, real-time systems. In this model, humans act as strategic policy-setters, defining the rules of engagement, while the agent executes the high-frequency actions required to enforce those policies autonomously.

4.5. Optimizing Performance and Cost: Resource-Awareness

The Resource-Aware Optimization pattern gives an agent the ability to dynamically manage computational, temporal, and financial resources. A common implementation uses a "Router Agent" that first classifies the complexity of a task. Based on this assessment and any budget constraints, it can dynamically switch between different models—for example, using a fast, affordable model like Gemini Flash for simple queries and a more powerful model like Gemini Pro for complex reasoning. The main trade-off is the latency and cost of the initial routing step, which must not outweigh the savings gained from using a more efficient downstream model.

4.6. Focusing on What Matters: The Prioritization Pattern

The Prioritization pattern is an agent's process for assessing and ranking tasks based on their significance, urgency, and dependencies. In environments with conflicting goals and limited resources, this capability is critical for focusing efforts on the most important tasks. Key criteria for prioritization include:

* Urgency (time sensitivity)
* Importance (impact on the primary objective)
* Dependencies (whether the task is a prerequisite for others)
* Resource availability

The logic for prioritization can itself become a complex component, requiring careful design to avoid becoming a bottleneck or misallocating resources based on flawed criteria.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. A Framework for Continuous Improvement and Governance

Deploying an agent is the beginning, not the end, of its lifecycle. For an agent to remain effective, safe, and aligned with its goals over time, it requires a framework for continuous evaluation, monitoring, and governance. These individual patterns and principles must be composed together to create truly sophisticated and accountable systems.

5.1. The Necessity of Continuous Evaluation

Traditional, static software tests are insufficient for probabilistic, non-deterministic agentic systems. Because agent performance can degrade over time due to factors like "concept drift"—where the nature of input data changes—ongoing measurement in live environments is essential. Continuous evaluation helps detect these issues early and ensures the agent remains effective and reliable.

5.2. Core Performance Metrics for Agentic Systems

To quantitatively measure agent performance, it is essential to track a set of core metrics:

* Response Quality: Assessing the accuracy, relevance, and factual correctness of the agent's outputs.
* Latency: Monitoring the time it takes for an agent to process a request and generate a response, which is crucial for user experience.
* Resource Consumption: Tracking metrics like token usage for LLM-powered agents to manage operational costs and identify opportunities for optimization.

5.3. Advanced Qualitative Assessment: LLM-as-a-Judge

The LLM-as-a-Judge concept is an innovative method for evaluating subjective qualities like "helpfulness," logical coherence, or adherence to a specific tone. This approach uses a separate, powerful LLM to assess an agent's output based on a predefined rubric. It offers a way to automate and scale nuanced, human-like evaluations that go beyond simple objective metrics.

5.4. Beyond the Output: Trajectory Evaluation

An "agent trajectory" is the sequence of steps, decisions, and tool uses an agent takes to arrive at a solution. Evaluating this trajectory is critical for understanding the agent's reasoning process. Even if the final output is correct, the path taken might be inefficient, illogical, or contain hidden errors. Analyzing the trajectory provides deeper insights for debugging and optimizing the agent's behavior.

5.5. The Evolution to Accountable Systems: The Contractor Model

The "contractor" model is an architectural shift designed to mitigate the inherent unreliability of prompt-based agents by enforcing a verifiable, deterministic agreement for high-stakes tasks. Its core components include:

* A Formalized Contract that moves beyond a simple prompt to specify verifiable deliverables, data sources, and scope of work.
* A Dynamic Lifecycle of Negotiation where the contractor agent can analyze the contract, request clarifications, and flag risks before execution begins.
* Iterative Execution and Self-Validation: The contractor agent operates on a principle of quality, not just speed. It can generate multiple solutions, run them against validation criteria or unit tests defined in the contract, score the outcomes, and only submit the version that meets all specifications.
* Hierarchical Decomposition where a primary contractor can act as a project manager, breaking a complex goal into smaller sub-tasks and generating new, formal "subcontracts" for other specialized agents.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. Composing Patterns for Sophisticated Systems

The true power of agentic design emerges not from using a single pattern in isolation, but from the artful composition of multiple patterns to create sophisticated, multi-layered systems. By weaving these patterns together, developers can build agents capable of tackling tasks that are far too complex for a single prompt or a simple workflow.

6.1. Synergy in Action: An AI Research Assistant Case Study

Consider an autonomous AI research assistant tasked with analyzing the impact of quantum computing on cybersecurity. Such a system would be a prime example of pattern composition:

* Initial Planning: A user's high-level query is first received by an agent that uses the Planning pattern to decompose the request into a multi-step research plan.
* Information Gathering: The agent then executes the plan using the Tool Use and RAG patterns to query external knowledge sources like Google Search and academic databases, gathering relevant articles and data.
* Multi-Agent Collaboration: The system could divide labor between specialized agents. A "Researcher" agent gathers raw information, which is then passed to a "Writer" agent to synthesize a coherent draft.
* Reflection and Self-Correction: A "Critic" agent reviews the draft for logical inconsistencies or factual errors. This feedback is passed back to the "Writer" agent, which uses it to refine and improve the report.
* Memory Management: Throughout this entire workflow, a Memory Management system maintains the state of the research plan, stores the gathered information, and tracks the drafts and feedback to ensure context is preserved.

6.2. The Future of Agentic AI: Autonomy, Ecosystems, and Safety

As we look ahead, several emerging trends will define the next generation of intelligent systems, pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

* Greater Autonomy and Reasoning: We will see a shift from human-in-the-loop systems, where the agent is a co-pilot, to human-on-the-loop systems, where agents are trusted to execute complex, long-running tasks with minimal oversight.
* Agentic Ecosystems and Standardization: The future will see the rise of open marketplaces where developers can deploy and orchestrate fleets of specialized agents. This will make communication standards like MCP and A2A paramount for ensuring interoperability.
* The Enduring Challenge of Safety and Alignment: As agents become more autonomous and interconnected, the need for robust safety patterns and a rigorous engineering discipline focused on testing, validation, and ethical alignment will become even more critical.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. Conclusion

Agentic design patterns are the architectural blueprints that transform the raw cognitive power of large language models into reliable, purposeful, and structured systems. They provide the discipline needed to guide AI beyond simple prompts toward complex, goal-oriented behavior. The principles of agentic design are the architectural grammar for instructing machines not just on what to do, but on how to behave reliably within a system. The canvas is before you; these patterns are your engineering blueprints. It is time to build.

Building an Effective AI Coding Agent: A Command-Line Approach

The concept of an AI coding agent represents a significant evolution beyond the simple generation of code snippets. While language models can produce functional code on demand, building a truly effective agent—one that can understand requirements, write, test, and refine its work—requires a deliberate architectural approach. This involves combining advanced reasoning, interactive tool use, and iterative self-improvement to create a system that emulates the workflow of a human developer. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the principles, architectural patterns, and practical steps needed to construct a robust AI coding agent designed to operate from the command line. We will begin with the foundational concepts, move to a step-by-step architectural guide, examine a practical code implementation, and conclude with a look at advanced self-improving systems.

1. The Foundational Pillars of an AI Coding Agent

Before assembling a complete agent, it is crucial to understand the three fundamental capabilities that allow it to function like a human programmer: the ability to understand instructions (prompting), the capacity to "think" through a problem (reasoning), and the power to execute and test its work (tool use). Mastering these pillars is the first step toward building a reliable and autonomous system.

1.1. The Art of Instruction: Prompting for Code

Effective prompting is the bedrock of communication with an AI coding agent. A well-crafted instruction steers the model’s probabilistic outputs toward a single, correct intention. Based on core prompting principles, the following are critical when instructing an agent to generate code:

* Clarity and Specificity: Instructions must be unambiguous and precise. Vague language like "write a script" can lead to unintended results. Instead, define the task, the desired output format (e.g., "a Python function"), and any specific requirements or limitations.
* Conciseness: While specificity is vital, instructions should remain direct. Unnecessary wording or complex sentence structures can obscure the primary goal. A prompt that is confusing to a human is likely confusing to the model.
* Using Action Verbs: Precise verbs guide the model to activate the relevant processes for a specific task. For a coding agent, effective verbs include Analyze, Create, Generate, Debug, and Refactor.
* Instructions Over Constraints: It is more effective to specify the desired action (e.g., "Return the output as a JSON object") than to outline what not to do (e.g., "Don't write a long explanation"). Positive instructions align the model with the objective rather than forcing it to focus on avoidance.
* Experimentation and Iteration: Prompt engineering is an iterative process. The most effective prompt is often discovered through a cycle of drafting, testing, analyzing the output, and refining the instructions to address shortcomings.

1.2. The Core Engine: Reasoning Through Complexity

A simple, direct output is often insufficient for complex coding challenges. An advanced agent must be able to reason through a problem, breaking it down into logical steps. The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique is a powerful method for enabling this capability. The core mechanism of CoT is forcing the LLM to externalize its reasoning trace as part of the generated output.

This is achieved through two main variations:

* Zero-Shot CoT: Simply appending a phrase like "Let's think step by step" to a prompt can trigger the model to expose its internal reasoning before giving a final answer.
* Few-Shot CoT: Providing the model with examples that demonstrate a step-by-step reasoning process before presenting the final answer gives it a clearer template for how to structure its own response.

This process mirrors a human developer's thought process, deconstructing a complex problem into a series of smaller, manageable parts. For a coding agent, this could involve analyzing requirements, outlining logic in pseudocode, writing the code, and considering edge cases. This transparency is vital not only for generating more accurate code but also for debugging the agent’s logic if it arrives at an incorrect solution.

1.3. From Thought to Action: The Necessity of Tool Use

An AI coding agent is incomplete without the ability to interact with an external environment. The Tool Use (Function Calling) pattern provides the mechanism for an agent to execute its plans. This is operationalized through the ReAct (Reason & Act) paradigm, which creates an iterative loop:

1. Thought: The agent reasons about the problem. For example: "I need to write a Python function that sorts a list of dictionaries by the 'age' key."
2. Action: Based on its thought, the agent decides to use a tool, generating a structured request to execute its code. For example: execute_python({"code": "def sort_by_age(data): return sorted(data, key=lambda x: x['age'])"}).
3. Observation: The agent receives the output from the tool—either the successful result of the code execution or an error message and traceback. For example: Observation: Execution successful. Function 'sort_by_age' is defined.

This Thought -> Action -> Observation loop allows the agent to write, test, and debug code autonomously. If the code fails, the error becomes the "Observation" that informs its next "Thought," such as, "The code failed with a TypeError. I need to correct the data type and try again." Architecturally, this loop is the agent's fundamental I/O mechanism—the bridge between its cognitive core and the external world, without which it remains a purely theoretical construct.

By mastering these foundational pillars, we can begin to assemble the components into a cohesive and functional architecture.

2. Architecting Your Coding Agent: A Step-by-Step Guide

This section provides a practical blueprint for constructing a coding agent. An effective agent is not a monolithic entity but is built around a core iterative loop of goal-setting, execution, and refinement. The following steps will guide you through designing this architecture, from defining the agent's mission to equipping it with the necessary tools and knowledge.

2.1. Step 1: Defining the Mission (Goal Setting)

The critical first step in building any agent is to define a clear and comprehensive objective. This mission statement serves as the agent's guiding principle for all subsequent actions and evaluations. A powerful example of this is the configuration of the "ADK code reviewer" Google Gem, which provides a detailed, role-based instruction set that functions as its primary goal.

Act as an expert code reviewer with a deep commitment to producing clean, correct, and simple code. Your core mission is to eliminate code "hallucinations" by ensuring every suggestion is grounded in reality and best practices. When I provide you with a code snippet, I want you to:

* Identify and Correct Errors: Point out any logical flaws, bugs, or potential runtime errors.
* Simplify and Refactor: Suggest changes that make the code more readable, efficient, and maintainable without sacrificing correctness.
* Provide Clear Explanations: For every suggested change, explain why it is an improvement, referencing principles of clean code, performance, or security.
* Offer Corrected Code: Show the "before" and "after" of your suggested changes so the improvement is clear.

Your feedback should be direct, constructive, and always aimed at improving the quality of the code.

This level of detail transforms a general-purpose model into a specialized agent with a well-defined mission, ensuring all its outputs are aligned with a specific quality standard.

2.2. Step 2: The Core Loop - Code, Test, Refine

The heart of a coding agent's behavior is an iterative, self-correcting loop. This process elevates the agent from a simple code generator to a genuine problem-solver and is a high-level, specialized implementation of the foundational Thought -> Action -> Observation ReAct paradigm. The loop consists of three key stages:

1. Code Generation: The agent makes its initial attempt to generate code that solves the user's problem.
2. Self-Evaluation: The agent critically reviews its own code against the goals defined in its initial mission. This often involves a separate LLM call where the agent acts as its own "code reviewer."
3. Refinement: Based on the self-generated critique, the agent enters a revision phase, using the feedback to improve the code and beginning the cycle anew.

This loop of self-correction continues until the agent determines that its code fully satisfies the original goals.

2.3. Step 3: Integrating a Code Execution Environment

To test its own code, an agent must be equipped with a code execution tool. This is the central idea behind Program-Aided Language Models (PALMs), which integrate language models with a deterministic programming environment. The architectural benefit of this pattern is clear: it offloads non-deterministic tasks (reasoning) to the LLM and deterministic tasks (computation) to a reliable code interpreter, creating a more robust and predictable system. A Google ADK agent, for example, can be equipped with a BuiltInCodeExecutor to run Python code in a sandboxed environment.

from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.code_executors import BuiltInCodeExecutor

coding_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    name='CodeAgent',
    instruction="""
    You're a specialist in Code Execution
    """,
    code_executor=[BuiltInCodeExecutor],
)


2.4. Step 4: Providing Knowledge with Long-Term Memory

A coding agent should not have to solve every problem from scratch. Providing it with long-term memory allows it to access external knowledge and learn from past experience. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful architectural pattern that serves this function. RAG connects the agent to an external knowledge base by embedding documents into a vector database, allowing the agent to retrieve relevant information via semantic search. The core components include:

* Chunking: Large documents (e.g., API documentation) are broken down into smaller, semantically coherent pieces.
* Embeddings: Each chunk is converted into a numerical vector that captures its meaning.
* Vector Database: These embeddings are stored in a specialized database optimized for fast similarity searches.
* Semantic Search: When the agent has a question, it is converted into an embedding and used to find the most relevant document chunks from the database.

This retrieved context is then added to the agent's prompt, grounding its response in factual, external data. More advanced implementations, like Agentic RAG, introduce a reasoning layer where the agent can actively validate, reconcile, or refine retrieved information before using it.

Architect's Note: The choice of vector database and chunking strategy are critical early design decisions. An inefficient retrieval pipeline can become a significant performance bottleneck, regardless of the LLM's quality.

With this architectural framework in place, we can now turn to a concrete, runnable example that brings these principles to life.

3. Practical Implementation: An Iterative Code Generation Agent

This section provides a concrete materialization of the architectural principles discussed previously by deconstructing a hands-on Python script from "Chapter 11." This script builds an autonomous agent that iteratively generates and refines Python code until user-defined quality benchmarks are met, operating entirely from the command line.

3.1. Dissecting the Agent's Logic

The core logic of the agent is contained within the run_code_agent function. This function implements the "Code, Test, Refine" cycle through an iterative loop, explicitly defined as for i in range(max_iterations):. Inside this loop, the agent performs a sequence of actions:

1. It generates a piece of Python code intended to solve the user's problem.
2. It submits this code to a second AI-driven function, get_code_feedback, for a critical review against the original goals.
3. It then uses a third function, goals_met, to make a final judgment: based on the feedback, have the goals been satisfied?
4. If the goals are met, the loop terminates. Otherwise, the feedback and the current code are used as context for the next iteration, and the refinement cycle continues.

3.2. Analyzing Key Functional Components

The script's effectiveness relies on three critical functions that work in concert to drive the iterative process:

* generate_prompt: This function is responsible for constructing the prompt for the LLM at each iteration. Crucially, it is dynamic. For the first iteration, it presents the initial problem and goals. For all subsequent iterations, it incorporates the previously generated code and the critical feedback received, guiding the LLM to make specific, targeted refinements.
* get_code_feedback: This function uses a second LLM call to simulate a code review. It provides the generated code snippet and the original list of goals to an LLM tasked with acting as a "Python code reviewer." The LLM provides a critique, identifying whether the goals for clarity, correctness, and edge case handling have been met and suggesting improvements.
* goals_met: This is the monitoring step that determines whether the iterative loop should continue. It takes the feedback from the code reviewer and asks the LLM to make a simple, final verdict: True or False. This binary decision provides a clear, automated signal to terminate the refinement process.

3.3. Running the Agent from the Command Line

The script is designed as a self-contained, executable application. The if __name__ == "__main__": block serves as the entry point, allowing the agent to be run directly from the command line. The use_case_input (the coding problem) and the goals_input (the quality checklist) are defined as strings and then passed to the run_code_agent function.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("\n🧠 Welcome to the AI Code Generation Agent")

    use_case_input = "Write code to find BinaryGap of a given positive integer"
    goals_input = "Code simple to understand, Functionally correct, Handles comprehensive edge cases, Takes positive integer input only, prints the results with few examples"
    run_code_agent(use_case_input, goals_input)


This demonstrates a complete, end-to-end implementation of a command-line AI coding agent that embodies the architectural principles of goal-setting, iterative refinement, and self-evaluation.

While this single-agent model is powerful, more complex problems can often be solved more effectively by creating a team of specialized agents that collaborate.

4. Advanced Concepts: Towards Self-Improving Systems

The true frontier of agentic AI lies in creating systems that not only solve problems but can also improve and collaborate over time. This section explores more sophisticated architectures, including the use of multi-agent "crews" for complex software development and the paradigm of agents that can modify their own source code to enhance their capabilities.

4.1. Multi-Agent Collaboration: A "Crew" for Coding

Instead of relying on a single, monolithic agent, a more robust and scalable approach is to separate concerns by creating a "crew" of specialized agents. This multi-agent system mimics the structure of a human software development team, where each member has a distinct role. This division of labor leads to higher-quality outputs. A typical coding crew might include:

* The Peer Programmer: Responsible for brainstorming and writing the initial code.
* The Code Reviewer: Critically examines code for errors and suggests improvements.
* The Documenter: Generates clear and concise documentation.
* The Test Writer: Creates a comprehensive suite of unit tests.
* The Prompt Refiner: Optimizes interactions with the other AI agents to improve clarity and efficiency.

This architecture shows a clear evolutionary path from the single-agent model in Section 3. The get_code_feedback function is a simplified version of the dedicated "Code Reviewer" agent, demonstrating how a single agent's self-reflection can be formalized into a distinct role within a more complex system.

4.2. Case Study: SICA, The Self-Improving Coding Agent

A significant leap towards truly autonomous systems is demonstrated by the Self-Improving Coding Agent (SICA), a case study in meta-programmability and autonomous system evolution. SICA's core capability is its ability to modify its own source code to improve its performance. The agent operates in an iterative cycle:

1. It reviews its past performance on a set of benchmark coding challenges.
2. It analyzes this performance data to identify potential improvements to its own internal logic or tool use.
3. It directly alters its own codebase to implement these improvements.
4. It re-tests itself against the benchmarks to validate whether the change resulted in a performance gain.

As documented in its performance graph (Chapter 9, Fig. 2), SICA demonstrated tangible progress through self-modification. Concrete improvements included evolving from a basic file-overwrite approach to a more sophisticated "Smart Edit" Tool and independently creating an "AST Symbol Locator" to navigate its own codebase more efficiently. SICA represents a significant step towards creating agents that can learn and adapt in a truly autonomous fashion.

4.3. Ensuring Safety: Guardrails for Code Generation

As coding agents become more autonomous and powerful, ensuring they operate safely and ethically is paramount. Guardrails, or safety patterns, are essential mechanisms to prevent the generation of insecure, malicious, or otherwise harmful code. These can be implemented as prompt-level constraints within the agent's core mission or as external validation steps—such as passing generated code through a security scanner—before it is executed or presented to the user. Implementing robust guardrails ensures that the agent operates within safe and predictable boundaries.

5. Conclusion

Building an effective AI coding agent is an act of architectural design, not just prompt engineering. It requires moving beyond simple, single-shot code generation to create a system that can reason, act, and improve. The core patterns discussed—a clearly defined goal, an iterative loop of reasoning and self-correction, and the essential use of external tools for execution and validation—provide the blueprint for constructing such a system. The future of the field points toward even greater autonomy, with advanced concepts like multi-agent collaboration and self-improvement paving the way for AI that can not only assist in software development but actively and intelligently participate in it. By applying these structured patterns, developers can transform Large Language Models from simple code completers into autonomous and reliable software engineering partners.

Core Components
To effectively leverage a frontier Large Language Model, this framework assigns distinct development roles to a team of specialized agents. These agents are not separate applications but are conceptual personas invoked within the LLM through carefully crafted, role-specific prompts and contexts. This approach ensures that the model's vast capabilities are precisely focused on the task at hand, from writing initial code to performing a nuanced, critical review.
The Orchestrator: The Human Developer: In this collaborative framework, the human developer acts as the Orchestrator, serving as the central intelligence and ultimate authority over the AI agents.
Role: Team Lead, Architect, and final decision-maker. The orchestrator defines tasks, prepares the context, and validates all work done by the agents.
Interface: The developer's own terminal, editor, and the native web UI of the chosen Agents.

The Context Staging Area: As the foundation for any successful agent interaction, the Context Staging Area is where the human developer meticulously prepares a complete and task-specific briefing.
Role: A dedicated workspace for each task, ensuring agents receive a complete and accurate briefing.
Implementation: A temporary directory (task-context/) containing markdown files for goals, code files, and relevant docs
The Specialist Agents: By using targeted prompts, we can build a team of specialist agents, each tailored for a specific development task.
The Scaffolder Agent: The Implementer
Purpose: Writes new code, implements features, or creates boilerplate based on detailed specifications.
Invocation Prompt: "You are a senior software engineer. Based on the requirements in 01_BRIEF.md and the existing patterns in 02_CODE/, implement the feature..."
The Test Engineer Agent: The Quality Guard
Purpose: Writes comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for new or existing code.
Invocation Prompt: "You are a quality assurance engineer. For the code provided in 02_CODE/, write a full suite of unit tests using [Testing Framework, e.g., pytest]. Cover all edge cases and adhere to the project's testing philosophy."
The Documenter Agent: The Scribe
Purpose: Generates clear, concise documentation for functions, classes, APIs, or entire codebases.
Invocation Prompt: "You are a technical writer. Generate markdown documentation for the API endpoints defined in the provided code. Include request/response examples and explain each parameter."
The Optimizer Agent: The Refactoring Partner
Purpose: Proposes performance optimizations and code refactoring to improve readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
Invocation Prompt: "Analyze the provided code for performance bottlenecks or areas that could be refactored for clarity. Propose specific changes with explanations for why they are an improvement."
The Process Agent: The Code Supervisor
Critique: The agent performs an initial pass, identifying potential bugs, style violations, and logical flaws, much like a static analysis tool.
Reflection: The agent then analyzes its own critique. It synthesizes the findings, prioritizes the most critical issues, dismisses pedantic or low-impact suggestions, and provides a high-level, actionable summary for the human developer.
Invocation Prompt: "You are a principal engineer conducting a code review. First, perform a detailed critique of the changes. Second, reflect on your critique to provide a concise, prioritized summary of the most important feedback."
Ultimately, this human-led model creates a powerful synergy between the developer's strategic direction and the agents' tactical execution. As a result, developers can transcend routine tasks, focusing their expertise on the creative and architectural challenges that deliver the most value.

integrate ck as a new tool for semantic code search and analysis.
https://github.com/BeaconBay/ck
I'll analyze both repositories to compare ck and ast-grep for your coding agent project. Let me examine the ck repository first to understand its capabilities.Based on the information gathered, **ck** and **ast-grep** serve different but complementary purposes for a coding agent in Rust. Here's a detailed comparison:

## Core Purpose & Philosophy

**ast-grep**:
- **Structural code search** using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- Focuses on code structure, syntax patterns, and transformations
- Language-aware parsing that understands code semantics
- Excellent for refactoring, linting, and precise code transformations

**ck**:
- **Semantic search** using embeddings and natural language understanding
- Finds code by meaning/concept rather than exact structure
- Combines traditional grep functionality with AI-powered semantic understanding
- Excellent for code discovery, exploration, and finding conceptually related code

## Key Differences

### Search Approach
- **ast-grep**: Pattern-based matching using AST structure (`console.log($MSG)` finds all console.log calls)
- **ck**: Meaning-based search (`"error handling"` finds try/catch, error returns, exception handling, etc.)

### Use Cases
**ast-grep excels at**:
- Precise refactoring (replace all `var` with `let`)
- Code linting and rule enforcement
- Structural code analysis
- Finding exact syntax patterns
- Code transformations with guaranteed correctness

**ck excels at**:
- Code exploration in unfamiliar codebases
- Finding conceptually similar code across different implementations
- Natural language queries ("find authentication logic")
- Discovering related functionality without knowing exact syntax
- AI agent code analysis and understanding

## Integration Benefits (Not Redundant!)

For a coding agent, having **both** tools provides significant advantages:

### 1. **Complementary Strengths**
```bash
# ast-grep: Find all function definitions with specific structure
ast-grep -p 'function $NAME($ARGS) { $BODY }'

# ck: Find all authentication-related functions regardless of structure
ck --sem "user authentication functions"
```

### 2. **Workflow Integration**
- **Discovery phase**: Use `ck` to find relevant code areas by concept
- **Analysis phase**: Use `ast-grep` to precisely analyze structure and patterns
- **Transformation phase**: Use `ast-grep` for safe, structure-aware modifications

### 3. **Different Query Types**
```bash
# Natural language exploration (ck)
ck --sem "database connection pooling"
ck --sem "retry logic with backoff"

# Precise structural queries (ast-grep)
ast-grep -p 'impl $TRAIT for $TYPE { $BODY }'
ast-grep -p 'async fn $NAME($ARGS) -> Result<$T, $E> { $BODY }'
```

## Practical Recommendations

**Use ast-grep when**:
- You need precise, structure-aware code modifications
- Implementing linting rules or code quality checks
- Performing safe refactoring operations
- You know the exact syntax pattern you're looking for

**Use ck when**:
- Exploring unfamiliar codebases
- Finding code by concept/functionality
- Your coding agent needs to understand "what this code does"
- Searching across multiple languages with different syntax but similar concepts

**Use both together when**:
- Building comprehensive code analysis pipelines
- Creating intelligent code suggestion systems
- Implementing context-aware code generation
- Developing advanced coding assistance features

## Conclusion

**ck and ast-grep are highly complementary, not redundant**. For a Rust coding agent:

- **ast-grep** provides precise, syntax-aware code manipulation capabilities
- **ck** provides intelligent, meaning-based code discovery and understanding
- Together, they enable both **understanding** (ck) and **manipulation** (ast-grep) of codebases
- The combination allows for more sophisticated coding agent capabilities than either tool alone

I'd recommend keeping both in your coding agent stack, as they solve different fundamental problems in code analysis and manipulation.

For OpenAI and GPT-5 model agents only.

To maximize performance and achieve superior results with GPT-5, always use an AI agent to refine and rewrite your human-written prompts before submitting them to the model. This iterative enhancement ensures clarity, specificity, and alignment with GPT-5's advanced capabilities.

For even better outcomes, provide your prompt-writing AI with this official resource as a reference: https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide. Instruct it to incorporate best practices from the guide, such as chain-of-thought reasoning, role-playing, and structured formatting, while adapting to your specific task.

You are an expert AI assistant tasked with implementing a context compression and compaction command for managing conversation history in large language models. This feature detects when the context window is approaching or exceeding its limit (e.g., due to token overflow) and automatically summarizes or prunes the history to maintain efficiency while preserving key information.

### Requirements:
- **Trigger Condition**: Monitor the total token count in the conversation history. If it exceeds 80% of the model's context window limit (e.g., 128k tokens for GPT-4), activate compaction. Use a reliable tokenizer like tiktoken for accurate counting.
- **Compaction Strategy**:
  - Identify and summarize redundant, repetitive, or low-relevance sections (e.g., greetings, off-topic asides).
  - Retain critical elements: user queries, key responses, unresolved tasks, and factual summaries.
  - Generate a concise summary message, such as: "The context window has overflowed. Summarizing the history: [brief overview of main topics, decisions, and open items]. Continuing from here..."
  - Optionally, allow user override or manual triggers via commands like `/compact` or `/summarize`.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Build this as a modular command in a Rust-based system (inspired by OpenAI's Codex architecture).
  - Integrate with the core prompt loop: Before generating a response, check history length and insert the compacted version if needed.
  - Ensure the summary is neutral, accurate, and under 20% of the original length.
  - Handle edge cases: Very short histories (no action), multi-turn debates (preserve arguments), code sessions (keep snippets intact).
- **Output Format**: After compaction, append the summary to the history and proceed with the next response. Log the before/after token counts for debugging.
- **Reference**: Base your implementation on the prompt structure in https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/core/src/prompt_for_compact_command.md, adapting it for dynamic history management.

Provide a complete, working code snippet in Rust (or the target language) demonstrating this command, including tests for overflow scenarios. Explain any deviations from the reference in comments.
