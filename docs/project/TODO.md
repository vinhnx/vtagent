To gather accurate and current information for this query, first access the internet via reliable search tools or APIs to fetch relevant data, or utilize the provided context7 as a primary source if it suffices. Then, rigorously double-check and verify the tool calling (function calling) capabilities, APIs, documentation, and implementation details for major LLM providers, including OpenAI (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT models), Anthropic (e.g., Claude models), and Google Gemini (e.g., Gemini models), ensuring comparisons on aspects like syntax, supported tools, error handling, security, and recent updates.

--
implement Gemini, Anthropic and OpenAI API key retrieval from environment variables and configuration files to enhance security and flexibility in managing sensitive information.

let role = match message.role {
    MessageRole::User => "user",
    MessageRole::Assistant => "assistant",
    MessageRole::System => continue,
    MessageRole::Tool => "user",
};

is MessageRole::Tool => "user", correct for Anthropic?

dont hard code model id in the project, find and replace with model config or constant


--
check vtagent-core/src/pty_renderer.rs, is it working?

--

restructure files in vtagent-core/src/, group related functionalities into submodules for better organization and clarity.

--

Please refactor the composable section of the file `vtagent-core/src/tools.rs`. The current implementation is overly large and monolithic, making it difficult to maintain and extend. Break it down into smaller, reusable modules or traits that promote better composability, separation of concerns, and modularity. Ensure the refactored code maintains the original functionality while improving readability, testability, and adherence to Rust best practices. Provide the updated code with clear comments explaining the changes.

reference this as roadmap for future improvements

k Claude Code could do to win back people switching to Codex CLI:

- open source Claude Code
- reduce sycophancy/make it less verbose (or add option for that)
- more transparency about how/why the model degrades
- fix tui flashing bug! PLEASE
- improve model hallucinations like GPT-5 has
- better thinking for removing files/lines of code to prevent accidental deletions
- less boilerplate or pseudo implementations (break it into working chunks if needed)
- ability to change/remove/reduce the system reminder prompts
- file based session auto-compact with much more detail on the conversation for future reference

what would you want to see improve to make CC work better for you?

GPT 5 only
If you want better results with GPT-5, use AI to rewrite your human-written prompt before providing it to GPT-5. Provide your prompt-writing agent with a link to https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide for even better results.

-   [ ] Update documentation and README.md to reflect all recent changes, including new features, configuration options, and usage instructions.
-   [ ] Add a comprehensive usage guide to the README.md, covering setup, available commands, configuration via AGENTS.md, and example workflows.
-   [ ] Ensure all documented commands and options match the current implementation.
-   [ ] Review and update any outdated instructions or references in both documentation and README.md.

streaming

---
Ensure that the event handling system in the agent loop properly captures, processes, and responds to all relevant events (such as user inputs, system triggers, or external signals) without conflicts or delays, while implementing a robust turn-based management structure that enforces sequential execution of agent actions, maintains state consistency across turns, handles interruptions gracefully, and includes error recovery mechanisms for seamless operation in multi-agent or interactive environments.
