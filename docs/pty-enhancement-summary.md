# PTY Enhancement Summary

## Overview
We've successfully enhanced the PTY (pseudo-terminal) functionality in the vtagent-core library by improving the exit code handling for commands executed through the PTY interface.

## Issues Identified
1. The original implementation was not correctly capturing exit codes from PTY commands
2. All commands were being reported as successful regardless of their actual exit status
3. There was no proper error handling for process status retrieval

## Improvements Made
1. **Proper Exit Code Handling**: Enhanced the PTY implementation to correctly capture and report exit codes from executed commands
2. **Robust Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for process status retrieval
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Maintained compatibility with both Unix and Windows systems
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensured that existing functionality continues to work as expected

## Technical Implementation
The enhancement involved modifying the `run_pty_cmd` function in `vtagent-core/src/tools.rs` to:

1. Retrieve the process status using `session.get_process().status()`
2. Parse the `WaitStatus` enum to determine the actual exit code
3. Handle various process termination scenarios:
   - Normal exit (`WaitStatus::Exited`)
   - Signal termination (`WaitStatus::Signaled`)
   - Process stopped (`WaitStatus::Stopped`)
   - Process continued (`WaitStatus::Continued`)
   - Process still alive (`WaitStatus::StillAlive`)
4. Fall back to backward-compatible behavior when status retrieval fails

## Testing
Comprehensive tests were added to verify:
1. Successful command execution (exit code 0)
2. Failed command execution (exit code 1)
3. Commands with specific exit codes (exit code 2, 42, etc.)
4. Commands that fail with specific error conditions

All tests pass, demonstrating that the enhanced PTY functionality correctly handles exit codes while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Impact
This enhancement provides more accurate feedback to the agent when executing terminal commands, allowing for better decision-making and error handling in automated workflows.
