# 2025-09-15

- documented tool call transparency guidelines

- attempted to merge latest main but repository has no remote
- added error and brevity rules for tool call transparency; clippy and check emit warnings, nextest missing
- integrated runtime messages before and after tool calls
- installed cargo-nextest; tests fail with unresolved imports
- migrated runtime messages to LLM-generated pre- and post-call notes
- added gemini runloop hooks so LLM states purpose and result for each tool call
