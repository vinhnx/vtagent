### Areas for Enhancement

#### 1. Final Answer Structure
**Codex Standard**: Detailed formatting guidelines for section headers, bullets, and monospace text.

**VTAgent Current**: Basic formatting guidance without specific structure rules.

**Recommendation**: Adopt Codex's detailed formatting standards:
```rust
"**Section Headers**
- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.
- Keep headers short (1–3 words) and in `**Title Case**`
- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.

**Bullets**
- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.
- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.
- Group into short lists (4–6 bullets) ordered by importance."
```

#### 2. Validation Philosophy
**Codex Standard**: Specific guidance on when to run validation commands based on approval modes.

**VTAgent Current**: General testing guidance without mode-specific behavior.

**Recommendation**: Add approval-mode-aware validation:
```rust
"Be mindful of whether to run validation commands proactively:
- When running in non-interactive modes, proactively run tests and lint
- When working in interactive modes, suggest validation steps first
- For test-related tasks, run tests regardless of approval mode"
```

#### 3. Ambition vs. Precision Balance
**Codex Standard**: Clear guidance on when to be ambitious vs. surgical.

**VTAgent Current**: General quality guidelines without context-specific guidance.

**Recommendation**: Add context-aware approach guidance:
```rust
"For tasks with no prior context, feel free to be ambitious and creative.
If operating in an existing codebase, make surgical, precise changes.
Use judicious initiative based on task scope and user needs."
```

## Recommended Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Final Answer Structure
Integrate Codex's detailed formatting guidelines into VTAgent's system prompt:

```rust
// Add to system prompt
"### Final Answer Structure and Style Guidelines
You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly:

**Section Headers**
- Use only when they improve clarity — not mandatory for every answer
- Keep headers short (1–3 words) in `**Title Case**`
- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header

**Bullets**
- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet
- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable
- Group into short lists (4–6 bullets) ordered by importance

**Monospace**
- Wrap commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers in backticks
- Never mix monospace and bold markers

**Tone**
- Keep voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner
- Use present tense and active voice
- Keep descriptions self-contained"
```

### 2. Approval-Mode-Aware Behavior
Add dynamic behavior based on system configuration:

```rust
// Add to configuration-aware section
"## VALIDATION PHILOSOPHY
Based on your current approval mode:
- **Non-interactive modes**: Proactively run tests, lint, and validation
- **Interactive modes**: Suggest validation steps and wait for confirmation
- **Test-related tasks**: Always run tests regardless of approval mode"
```

### 3. Context-Sensitive Approach
Enhance the existing guidelines with Codex's ambition vs. precision framework:

```rust
// Add to software engineering workflow
"## APPROACH CALIBRATION
- **New projects/features**: Be ambitious and demonstrate creativity
- **Existing codebases**: Make surgical, precise changes with respect for existing patterns
- **Vague scope**: Add high-value creative touches
- **Tight specification**: Be surgical and targeted"
```

### 4. Enhanced Progress Updates
Integrate Codex's progress update guidelines:

```rust
// Add to responsiveness section
"## PROGRESS UPDATES
For longer tasks requiring multiple tool calls:
- Provide concise updates (8-10 words) recapping progress
- Before large work chunks, inform user what you're about to do
- Connect current actions to previous work for momentum
- Demonstrate understanding of remaining work"
```

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. **Final Answer Structure**: Adopt Codex formatting standards
