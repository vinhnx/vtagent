# Basic VTCode Usage Example

This example shows how to use VTCode for code analysis and tool execution.

## Available Tools:
- simple_search: File search and operations
- bash: Bash-like commands with PTY support
- run_terminal_cmd: Terminal command execution

## Example Workflow:
1. Use simple_search for file operations
2. Use bash for system operations
3. Use run_terminal_cmd for complex terminal tasks

# Advanced VTCode Usage

## Tool Integration:
- All tools now support PTY for terminal emulation
- AST-based code analysis and transformation
